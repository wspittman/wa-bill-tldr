      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1033 is to allow counties in Washington State to adopt their own licensing and regulatory systems for child care providers, including both child care centers and family home providers. This bill aims to shift some regulatory power from the state to local governments, giving them the authority to set standards for the licensing and regulation of these providers. Key changes include setting a timeline for counties to implement their own ordinances by July 1, 2026, and removing the requirement for state regulation of child care facilities once counties take over.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Local Licensing and Regulation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties can create ordinances for licensing and regulating child care centers and family home providers, with new regulations to be effective no earlier than July 1, 2026.</li>\n<li>Counties must establish ordinances addressing aspects like safety, operation plans, provider competence, required staffing, child care adequacy, well-being, and recreational opportunities.</li>\n<li>Counties will notify the state department 60 days before their ordinances take effect, which will transfer regulatory authority to the counties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting and Oversight</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties must report quarterly to the state department, including details about their regulations and a list of licensed providers, specifying the type of provider and maximum children allowed.</li>\n<li>The department will compile a list of counties that locally license child care providers to be made available on its website.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>State Interaction and Support</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The state department will not regulate locally licensed child care centers but will provide technical assistance as needed.</li>\n<li>The department must create rules allowing locally licensed providers to participate in statewide programs like the working connections child care program, although participation in the early achievers program is required without specifically rating requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Third-Party Analysis</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The state department is required to contract a third-party consultant to analyze the local licensing and regulation framework, comparing it with state standards and reporting findings by October 1, 2030.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Repeals and Amendments</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The current state regulation previously allowing county regulation of family day-care centers is repealed effective July 1, 2026, which aligns with the new local licensing authority established in this bill.</li>\n</ul>"
