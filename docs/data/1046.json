      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1046 is to provide legal protection for individuals who rescue vulnerable persons or domestic animals from locked vehicles. The bill aims to grant immunity from civil liability for any damage caused to the vehicle during the rescue. This is intended to encourage people to take action in emergencies without fear of legal repercussions. Key changes include the specific conditions under which immunity applies, focusing on scenarios where the rescued individuals are in imminent danger.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Legal Immunity for Rescuers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person can enter a locked motor vehicle to rescue a vulnerable person or domestic animal without facing civil liability if they:<ul>\n<li>Determine the vehicle is locked or there is no reasonable way for the vulnerable individual or animal to exit on their own.</li>\n<li>Have a good faith belief that the individual or animal is in imminent danger.</li>\n<li>Notify law enforcement or call 911 before or immediately after entering the vehicle.</li>\n<li>Use only necessary force to enter the vehicle.</li>\n<li>Remain with the rescued individual or animal in a safe location until help arrives. </li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These provisions aim to protect those who act in emergency situations while emphasizing the need for responsible behavior during rescues.</p>"
