The primary purpose of the shelter care hearing is to determine whether the child can be immediately and safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending.

Upon the request of the child's attorney, parent, guardian, or legal custodian, the court shall schedule the hearing within 72 hours of the request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.

The paramount consideration for the court shall be the health, welfare, and safety of the child.

If actual notice was not given to the parent, guardian, or legal custodian and the whereabouts of such person is known or can be ascertained, the court shall order the department to make diligent efforts to advise the parent, guardian, or legal custodian of the status of the case, including the date and time of any subsequent hearings, and their rights under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.090'>13.34.090</a>;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) Whether the child can be safely returned home while the adjudication of the dependency is pending;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) What efforts have been made to place the child with a relative.

      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1092 is to enhance the safety of children by amending existing laws related to child protection. The bill aims to streamline the process by which law enforcement and child protective services can take action when a child is at risk of imminent or serious physical harm, particularly due to abuse or neglect involving controlled substances, including high-potency synthetic opioids. Key changes from the prior version include explicit provisions for using controlled substances while caring for a child as grounds for removal and defining new procedures for hearings related to child custody. These changes aim to prioritize child safety, while ensuring parents are informed and allowed to participate in hearings.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Child Custody and Removal</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Law enforcement or child protective services can take a child into custody if there is sufficient evidence of dependency and reasonable grounds that removal is necessary to prevent imminent or serious harm.</li>\n<li>The definition of harm now explicitly includes risks related to high-potency synthetic opioids and serious neglect.</li>\n<li>Parents must be notified and given the opportunity to be heard if the necessary conditions for immediate removal are not met.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Shelter Care Hearings</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A shelter care hearing must occur within 72 hours of a child's removal to determine if the child can safely return home.</li>\n<li>Parents and legal custodians not represented in court during the initial hearing should be informed of their rights, including the right to legal counsel.</li>\n<li>Tests and testimonies regarding shelter care necessity must be validated by sworn statements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Placement Considerations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The court must consider placing children with relatives or suitable individuals unless there are good reasons to opt for licensed foster care.</li>\n<li>Reasonable efforts should be made to facilitate sibling contact and educational stability during placements.</li>\n<li>A presumption that placement with relatives is in the child's best interest must be considered, along with the support for reunification with parents.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Parental Rights and Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Courts must ensure that any services offered to parents are voluntary, though participation in prevention services can be requested for the child’s safety.</li>\n<li>Parents are provided the opportunity to restructure custody agreements based on demonstrated changes in circumstances, including sobriety from substance use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting and Investigation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased responsibility for various professionals to report suspected cases of child abuse or neglect is outlined.</li>\n<li>Use of controlled substances without a prescription while caring for a child constitutes reasonable grounds for removal action by authorities.</li>\n<li>New provisions emphasize the importance of timely investigations and thorough documentation regarding child safety and welfare.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill aims to create a more effective and responsive child welfare system, ensuring that children's safety is prioritized while remaining fair to the rights of parents and guardians.</p>"
