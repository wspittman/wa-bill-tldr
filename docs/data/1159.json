      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1159 is to update the crime of endangerment with a controlled substance, specifically focusing on the protection of dependent children and adults. The bill amends existing laws to redefine what entails endangerment and clarifies the offenses related to the exposure of vulnerable individuals to harmful substances. Key changes include the substitution of \"intentionally\" with \"recklessly,\" and a broader description of prohibited controlled substances to include any controlled substance other than cannabis.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Endangerment Definition</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person is guilty of the crime of endangerment with a controlled substance if they recklessly permit a dependent child or dependent adult to ingest, inhale, absorb, or have contact with a controlled substance other than cannabis.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Affirmative Defense</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is an affirmative defense to argue that the controlled substance was:<ul>\n<li>Administered or provided during the delivery of health care services.</li>\n<li>Obtained from a valid prescription or order of a practitioner in the course of their professional practice.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Crime Classification</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Endangerment with a controlled substance is classified as a class B felony, which indicates the seriousness of the offense and potential penalties.</li>\n</ul>"
