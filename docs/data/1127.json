The bill clarifies the abandonment period and changes reporting procedures for trusts associated with these contracts. Key changes from the previous legislation include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establishing a three-year period after which funds from these contracts are presumed abandoned.</li>\n<li>Specifying conditions under which contracts are reported as unclaimed.</li>\n<li>Adjusting holder reporting requirements and owner notification processes.\nThese modifications aim to improve clarity and efficiency in managing unclaimed property without significantly affecting state revenue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Abandonment and Reporting</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prearrangement funeral service contracts are presumed abandoned three years after the earlier of:<ul>\n<li>The beneficiary's date of death.</li>\n<li>The date the beneficiary reaches the age of 107.</li>\n<li>Fifty years post-execution of the contract.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Notification Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Holders must notify apparent owners via mail if there’s a valid address, and must also consider contacting owners through email if consent was given.</li>\n<li>Properties valued at $50 or more require notification to owners before reporting unclaimed property to the state.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Holder Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased emphasis on accurate reporting of unclaimed property by holders, requiring specific details about each owner.</li>\n<li>Reports must now include details reflecting the administrator's compliance with notification requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Trust Management</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Trusts for prearrangement funeral service contracts must be handled as unclaimed property if the owner cannot be located after the set abandonment period.</li>\n<li>Changes clarify owner rights and specify that the State will take custody of these trusts after they are deemed abandoned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Exemptions and Retroactive Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Certain sections will apply retroactively and prospectively depending on the effective dates outlined in the bill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Penalties and Interest</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Penalties for noncompliance with reporting requirements include interest for late payments or delivery of unclaimed property to the state.</li>\n<li>Holders may be assessed penalties for failing to report property or deliver it timely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Miscellaneous Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill also introduces regulations regarding how virtual currency and other intangible property is treated within the unclaimed property act.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill seeks to streamline the handling of unclaimed property, specifically focusing on funeral contracts, to ensure that both holders and owners have clear guidance on their obligations and rights.</p>"

The main goals are to refine the abandonment periods and reporting procedures specifically for prearrangement funeral service contracts and trusts. Additionally, the edits make changes to holder reporting requirements, owner notification requirements, and other aspects which are not expected to significantly impact state revenue. These modifications are intended to better serve the interests of deceased individuals and their beneficiaries while ensuring that unclaimed properties are properly handled by the state.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Abandonment Periods</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The text specifies that any trust related to prearrangement funeral service contracts is considered abandoned three years after one of these events:<ul>\n<li>The date of death of the contract beneficiary.</li>\n<li>The date the beneficiary would turn 107.</li>\n<li>Fifty years after the contract was executed.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Holder Reporting Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The limit for reporting properties has been reduced from $50 to $5.</li>\n<li>Reports now must include the apparent owner's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number when known and readily available.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Owner Notification Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Holders must notify apparent owners by first-class mail not less than 60 days and not more than 180 days before filing reports.</li>\n<li>If an apparent owner has consented to email notifications, notice must also be sent by email.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Updates on Financial Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The amendment adds provisions related to virtual currency, stating that holders must liquidate virtual currency within 30 days prior to filing a report.</li>\n<li>The process for holders filing reports has been clarified, especially concerning the penalties for non-compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Contract and Fee Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Contracts providing for compensation exceeding 5% of the value of property expected to be recovered are unenforceable.</li>\n<li>New provisions specify how the administrator must handle debts owed by the owner, such as child support or taxes, before delivering property to them.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>New Sections and Repeals</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New sections have been added to clarify reporting requirements and owner notifications.</li>\n<li>RCW 63.30.670 has been repealed, reflecting obsolete reporting requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, these changes are designed to ensure more efficient handling of unclaimed properties, maintaining transparency and accountability within the state administration.</p>"
