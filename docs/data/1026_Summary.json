      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1026 is to enhance the protection of spouses by enabling them to share benefits from the long-term services and supports trust program. This bill introduces provisions that allow individuals to transfer their available benefit units to their spouse under specific conditions. The key change from the previous version is the addition of this transfer mechanism, which aims to provide greater financial support options for families facing long-term care needs.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Benefit Transfer Eligibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A qualified individual may transfer any or all of their available benefit units to their spouse if:<ul>\n<li>The receiving spouse does not meet the qualification criteria as outlined in RCW 50B.04.050.</li>\n<li>The receiving spouse, after evaluation, is determined to meet the necessary functional criteria as specified in RCW 50B.04.060.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Alternatively, if the receiving spouse has met the qualified individual criteria:<ul>\n<li>They must also be evaluated and found to meet the functional criteria for eligibility.</li>\n<li>Additionally, the receiving spouse must have exhausted their benefit units under the program.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Transfer Impact</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The benefit units that are transferred to the spouse will be deducted from the original qualified individual's available units.</li>\n</ul>"
