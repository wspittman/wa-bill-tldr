      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1045 is to expand the definition of \"uniformed personnel\" to include all law enforcement officers who are employed by any city, town, or county in Washington State. This change removes previous population requirements for these positions, allowing more officers to fall under this designation. The impact of this amendment could enhance the collective bargaining rights and benefits for these officers, ensuring broader protection and support in their roles.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Definition of Uniformed Personnel</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill amends the definition of \"uniformed personnel\" to include:<ul>\n<li>All law enforcement officers employed by city, town, or county governments, removing the prior requirement that these entities have a minimum population of 2,500.</li>\n<li>The removal of the population requirement for counties, which previously stated that counties needed a population of 10,000 or more.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Coverage Expansion</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The amendment extends definitions to cover:<ul>\n<li>Correctional employees, both uniformed and nonuniformed, in various correctional facilities based on specified population requirements of the counties.</li>\n<li>Firefighters and emergency personnel, including those providing crash fire rescue or emergency medical services, enhancing their classification under uniformed personnel.</li>\n<li>Public safety telecommunicators, with exceptions for those employed by state agencies.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This revision is significant as it broadens the scope of rights and protections for law enforcement and associated personnel across Washington State.</p>"
