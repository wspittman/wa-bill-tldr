Therefore, the legislature recognizes the benefit and need for prearrangement funeral services and intends to modernize the requirements placed upon funeral establishments who offer prearrangement funeral services.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span
