      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>This bill aims to enhance fire protection services in rural Washington by establishing a competitive grant program. The goal is to fund capital projects undertaken by local governments that improve fire protection facilities. Key changes from previous legislation include a structured approach for prioritizing grant applications based on specific criteria such as community need, project readiness, and leverage of additional funds. This is expected to expand and strengthen fire protection resources in areas that are often underserved.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Grant Program Establishment</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Commerce will create a grant program specifically for local governments in rural counties to support fire protection services capital projects.</li>\n<li>A committee will be formed to set the criteria and application process for the grant program, including representatives from various local government entities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Application Prioritization</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Grants will consider several factors for prioritization:<ul>\n<li>Insurance services office fire rating of the jurisdiction.</li>\n<li>Extent of leveraged funding from other sources.</li>\n<li>Ability of the local government to generate its own funding.</li>\n<li>Critical nature of the project affecting community health and safety.</li>\n<li>Readiness of the project for immediate construction.</li>\n<li>Location of the project in a distressed area.</li>\n<li>Potential for service consolidation or regionalization.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Funding Guidelines</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Grants will only be awarded if match funding from private or public sources is secured. Match funding can include cash, property, or other resources.</li>\n<li>The maximum funding available per jurisdiction is set at $2,000,000 for each two-year period.</li>\n<li>Grant contracts will require the facilities improved with grant funds to be maintained for a specified period to ensure public benefit, with penalties for non-compliance.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department must submit an annual report by November 1 starting in 2026, detailing:<ul>\n<li>Number of applications and total requested funding.</li>\n<li>Approved projects and their scores based on prioritization criteria.</li>\n<li>Total grant disbursements for the prior fiscal year.</li>\n<li>Total funds obligated and the timing of these obligations.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The Department may collect necessary data from grant recipients to compile the report.</li>\n</ul>"
