      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The bill aims to enhance the rights of parents or guardians regarding their children's education by allowing them to audio record individualized education program (IEP) team meetings. The primary goal is to ensure that parents can keep personal records of discussions related to their child's education. A key change introduced is an exemption that allows these recordings without needing the consent of all participants, which contrasts with general recording laws that require consent from all parties involved in a conversation.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Parental Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents or guardians of a student are granted the right to audio record their child's IEP team meetings without needing to obtain prior consent from other attendees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compliance Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All other members of the IEP team must continue to comply with existing recording laws (RCW 9.73.030) when recording meetings, unless the recording is done by the parent or guardian as specified above. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Current Law</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific amendments are made to RCW 9.73.030 to explicitly state that the section does not apply to recordings made by parents or guardians during IEP meetings, acknowledging their newly granted rights.</li>\n</ul>"
