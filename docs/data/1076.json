The key change includes the process for selecting health technologies for evaluation, prioritizing those with established patient access through Medicare or recognized treatment guidelines. The bill aims to enhance the assessment of health technologies by ensuring that re-evaluations occur regularly based on new evidence. This is expected to improve the quality of healthcare decisions regarding which technologies are considered safe, effective, and cost-effective for public health programs.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Selection of Health Technologies</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The administrator must select health technologies for review, emphasizing technologies:<ul>\n<li>With established patient access through Medicare or expert guidelines.</li>\n<li>That raise concerns about safety, efficacy, or cost-effectiveness.</li>\n<li>For which actual state expenditures are high due to demand or costs.</li>\n<li>That have sufficient evidence for a complete review.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Rereview Process</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Health technologies previously evaluated will undergo a rereview at least every eighteen months if new evidence could impact the initial determination.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Petition for Review</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Interested parties can petition for the review of technologies not chosen by the administrator.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Evidence Assessment</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon selection for review, an evidence-based assessment contract must be established, focusing on:<ul>\n<li>Valid and reliable evidence regarding the technology’s safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness.</li>\n<li>Consideration of unique impacts on specific populations based on various demographics.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Considerations for Rare Diseases</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For life-threatening or rare diseases, the review must consider:<ul>\n<li>Clinical trials published in peer-reviewed literature.</li>\n<li>Expert testimony regarding the feasibility of certain trial designs.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Committee Determinations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The committee will set conditions under which a technology is covered and establish criteria for determining medical necessity.</li>\n<li>The committee must conduct assessments transparently, allow for public comments, and may utilize advisory groups for specialized input.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Adherence to Medicare Guidelines</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The committee's decisions should align with Medicare decisions and expert guidelines unless substantial evidence indicates otherwise.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Timeliness of Reviews</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The healthcare authority will publish new technology assessment submissions on its website and communicate decisions within 180 days, providing explanations for any adverse determinations.</li>\n</ul>"
