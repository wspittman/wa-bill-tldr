      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1176 is to establish greater consistency in the provision of health care services to minors under the age of 17. The bill amends existing laws to allow minors aged 17 and older to consent to both medical and mental health treatments without needing parental consent. Key changes include extending the age from 14 to 17 for various health-related consents and clarifying the financial responsibilities of parents regarding certain medical procedures. The bill aims to facilitate access to necessary health services for minors while also outlining the conditions under which parents can be notified or held liable.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Consent for Healthcare Services</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minors aged 17 years or older may consent to hospital, medical, and surgical care for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV prevention without parental consent.</li>\n<li>A minor aged 17 or older can admit themselves to inpatient mental health or substance use disorder treatment without parental authorization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Parental Notification</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The professional person in charge must notify a parent when a minor 17 or older is voluntarily admitted to an inpatient mental health facility, except in cases where disclosure could harm the minor.</li>\n<li>Notification regarding substance use treatment is required only if the minor consents to share that information or as allowed by federal law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Minor's Right to Leave Treatment</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minors aged 17 and older may give written notice of their intent to leave treatment at any time, with specific notification requirements for different types of treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Financial Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents or guardians of minors under 17 are not liable for costs of abortion services received without their consent, except in emergency situations where the life of the minor is at stake.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Abolishment of Mature Minor Rule</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill eliminates the principle of implied emancipation (mature minor rule) which currently allows minors to consent to health care services on their own authority, unless specifically permitted by law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If any part of the act is found invalid, the remaining provisions will still be valid and applicable.</li>\n</ul>"
