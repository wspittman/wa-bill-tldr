      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1080 is to enhance fee disclosure for lodging accommodations, ensuring that consumers are fully informed of all charges associated with their stay at hotels and short-term rentals. The key change in this bill is the requirement that all fees or charges, except for government-imposed taxes and fees, must be included in the advertised room rate. This aims to prevent hidden fees that can surprise consumers at the time of booking. The bill also sets penalties for non-compliance to promote adherence to these disclosure requirements.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Hotel Fees Disclosure</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All fees or charges required to stay at a hotel must be included in the advertised room rate.</li>\n<li>Government-imposed taxes and fees must be disclosed in the total price before a consumer reserves the stay.</li>\n<li>This requirement applies to advertisements and offers made in or from Washington state.</li>\n<li>Violators, who should have known about the misleading advertisement, may face civil penalties up to $10,000 for each infraction. Enforcement actions may be initiated by local attorneys or the attorney general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Short-Term Rental Fees Disclosure</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Similar to hotel requirements, all fees for short-term rentals must be clearly displayed in the offered rate.</li>\n<li>Government-imposed taxes and fees must also be included in the total price prior to booking.</li>\n<li>This provision similarly applies to all forms of advertising and offers in and from Washington state.</li>\n<li>Penalties for violations match those outlined for hotels, with the possibility of civil fines up to $10,000 and enforcement by legal authorities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Effective Date</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025, as it is deemed necessary for the preservation of public peace, health, or safety.</li>\n</ul>"
