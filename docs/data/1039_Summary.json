Each city that is located in such a county shall be included within an urban growth area. An urban growth area may include more than a single city. An urban growth area may include territory that is located outside of a city only if such territory already is characterized by urban growth whether or not the urban growth area includes a city, or is adjacent to territory already characterized by urban growth, or is a designated new fully contained community as defined by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=36.70A.350'>36.70A.350</a>.

As part of this planning process, each city within the county must include areas sufficient to accommodate the broad range of needs and uses that will accompany the projected urban growth including, as appropriate, medical, governmental, institutional, commercial, service, retail, and other nonresidential uses.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Each urban growth area shall permit urban densities and shall include greenbelt and open space areas. In the case of urban growth areas contained totally within a national historical reserve, the city may restrict densities, intensities, and forms of urban growth as determined to be necessary and appropriate to protect the physical, cultural, or historic integrity of the reserve.

      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1039 is to establish a framework for cities and tribal governments to collaborate in providing urban governmental services on tribal lands adjacent to urban areas, especially focusing on areas beyond city boundaries. This bill clarifies that such agreements must comply with the state's growth management act. Key changes from previous regulations include the explicit allowance for mutual agreements between cities and tribes regarding service provision, aiming to ensure the effective management of urban growth and related services on tribal lands.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>City-Tribal Agreements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities and federally recognized Indian tribes can contract for urban governmental services beyond city growth boundaries to tribal lands characterized by urban development.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Urban Growth Area Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates are made to RCW 36.70A.110 to outline how urban growth areas are designated in accordance with population projections and development pressures.</li>\n<li>Coordination between counties, cities, and tribes is mandated when planning urban growth areas, particularly when an Indian tribe participates in the process.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Consultation Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties must engage in meaningful consultation with affected tribes before revising urban growth areas, addressing potential impacts on cultural resources and treaty rights. Notification to tribes must occur through multiple methods, including mail.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Urban Growth Expansion Restrictions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Prohibits the expansion of urban growth areas into the 100-year floodplain of certain rivers unless specific conditions are met, such as the lack of alternative buildable areas or existing urban development within the floodplain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Conditions for Sanitary Sewer Service</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarifies that counties and cities are not required to provide sewer services to properties in urban growth areas if they already have functioning on-site sewage systems, provided these systems are regularly inspected.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Special Provisions for Specific Regions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Specifically allows a city and a federally recognized Indian tribe, located in a county along the Columbia River with a population over 500,000, to extend urban services to tribal properties abutting the city by December 31, 2028.</li>\n</ul>"
