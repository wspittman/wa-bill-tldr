style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 1.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature finds that rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and other digital tools have enabled users to easily create or alter images in a realistic manner, resulting in the widespread proliferation of fabricated depictions that are virtually indistinguishable from authentic images.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that images of child sexual abuse have been reported in training datasets for artificial intelligence image generation, and that artificial intelligence and other digital tools are increasingly capable of generating realistic images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further finds that artificial intelligence and other digital tools have introduced significant barriers to the detection and prosecution of crimes involving depictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, including by contributing to the increased volume of child sexual abuse material available online, facilitating the alteration of real images of child sexual abuse to evade conventional detection methods, and subverting conventional digital detection tools such as hash match identification.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further finds that even where a fabricated depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct does not depict an identifiable victim, exposure to such material may nonetheless desensitize the creator and viewers to the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors, distort perceptions of healthy sexuality and relationships, and increase the likelihood of future victimization.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature further finds that it has a legitimate and compelling interest in preventing the sexual exploitation and abuse of children, and that even fabricated depictions of such conduct are patently offensive and may be regulated without infringing on constitutionally protected activity.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore, the legislature intends to expand Washington's existing prohibitions against fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct to include circumstances where the depicted minor is not identifiable.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span

The bill addresses concerns raised by the proliferation of realistic images generated using artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital tools, which complicate the detection and prosecution of related crimes. Key changes include extending prohibitions to cover cases where minors are not identifiable, thereby aiming to protect children from sexual exploitation and abuse even when the depicted minor is a fictitious creation.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Expansion of Prohibitions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill expands existing laws to include fabricated depictions of minors engaged in sexually explicit conduct, even when the depicted minor is not identifiable.</li>\n<li>It emphasizes the state's interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definitions and Offenses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Digitization</strong>: Refers to creating or altering visual matter to depict a minor in a realistic manner, including using AI.</li>\n<li><strong>Fabricated Depiction</strong>: Defined as any visual representation of a minor in sexually explicit conduct that is digitally created or altered.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Criminal Offenses for Adults</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Dealing in Depictions</strong>: </p></li>\n<li><p>First-degree offenses include knowingly developing or distributing visual matter depicting minors in sexual acts, punishable as a class B felony.</p></li>\n<li><p>Second-degree offenses involve less explicit conduct and carry the same class B felony punishment.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Possession</strong>: </p></li>\n<li><p>Possessing depictions of minors in sexual conduct is also criminalized, with separate convictions for each instance.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Criminal Offenses for Minors</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Minors are prohibited from distributing or possessing visual matter depicting other minors, with varying degrees of severity based on the depicted conduct and the ages of the minors involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Specific Offenses for Viewing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Intentional viewing of explicit depictions over the internet is classified into first and second-degree offenses, correlating to the nature of the material.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Legal Defenses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Clarifies that lack of knowledge regarding a minor's identity in depicted materials is not a valid defense in prosecutions involving fabricated depictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes aim to strengthen the legal framework supporting the prevention of child sexual exploitation, adapting to the new challenges posed by technology.</p>"
