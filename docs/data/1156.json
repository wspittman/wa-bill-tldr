      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1156 is to allow volunteer firefighters in Washington State to participate in the state deferred compensation program. This bill amends the existing regulation (RCW 41.50.770) to formally include volunteer firefighter participants as eligible employees. The impact of this change is significant as it opens up financial planning options for volunteer firefighters, allowing them to defer income and save for retirement alongside other types of public employees.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Eligibility and Inclusion</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Volunteer firefighters are added to the definition of \"employees\" eligible for the state deferred compensation program, granting them similar financial benefits as full-time and part-time state workers.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Deferred Compensation Participation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The state is authorized to contract with eligible employees, including volunteer firefighters, to defer a portion of their income into a compensated account, subject to federal limits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Enrollment Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New full-time state employees, including volunteer firefighters, are automatically enrolled in the deferred compensation plan unless they opt out. A default contribution of three percent of their taxable compensation is set if no specific deferral or investment choice is made.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Roth Option Availability</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Beginning December 1, 2023, a Roth option must be provided for employees in the deferred compensation plan, allowing for post-tax contributions and potential tax-free withdrawals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Self-Direction of Investments</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Participants in the deferred compensation plans can self-direct their investment choices based on available options defined by the state investment board.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Coverage and Participation in Pension Systems</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Eligibility for optional salary deferral programs will not affect an employee's membership or participation in public pension systems, ensuring that volunteer firefighters can also maintain their retirement benefits while participating in the deferred compensation program.</li>\n</ul>"
