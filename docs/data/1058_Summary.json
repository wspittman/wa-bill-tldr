The legislature further finds that maintenance and improvements to the railroad system are needed to support modern 286,000 pound railcars, foster economic development, increase infrastructure resiliency, avoid supply chain disturbances, and meet carbon reduction goals for transportation greenhouse gases. The legislature intends to provide incentives to the rail industry that can lead to a more effective short line rail system.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.04'>82.04</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(1) A credit is allowed against taxes due under this chapter for expenditures made by an eligible taxpayer pursuant to subsection (2) of this section.
