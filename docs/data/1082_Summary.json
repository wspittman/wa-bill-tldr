      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The bill aims to modify the qualifications for licensed child care providers in Washington State. It allows these providers until August 1, 2028, to demonstrate their competency through experience rather than requiring formal education certificates. This change is intended to help experienced caregivers continue working without the burden of obtaining additional certifications if they meet specific criteria. The bill also establishes a stakeholder group to improve staff qualification requirements and the verification processes, promoting a more efficient system for child care operation and management.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Experience-Based Competency</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Licensed child care providers can show their competency through practical experience until at least August 1, 2028, as an alternative to holding specific education certificates, under certain conditions:<ul>\n<li>Must have active employment in a role that requires one of the specified certificates.</li>\n<li>Must have been employed without breaks since August 1, 2021, or have a cumulative seven years in licensed child care settings.</li>\n<li>Completion and adherence to health and safety training and child care basics are required.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Streamlined Recognition Process</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The department will set up a process to recognize providers who meet the experience competency criteria without needing to submit an application.</li>\n<li>Providers fulfilling these criteria will be notified by the department regarding their qualification status.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Flexible Requirements for Specific Programs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The department may impose stricter qualifications for providers working with the early childhood education and assistance program. </li>\n<li>Experience-based competency requirements may not apply to certain program staff.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Stakeholder Group Formation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Children, Youth, and Families will create a group to explore and recommend improvements in early learning staff qualifications and verification processes.
