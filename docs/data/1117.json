Individuals have not been able to register vehicles that meet federal manufacturing standards that they own. From September 2023 to September 2024, the department of licensing had to grant 407,541 exemptions to the policy so that vehicles could be registered, at additional time and resources for the people, vehicle subagents, and the governmental organizations that administer vehicle registrations. The state benefits when every vehicle that operates on the public roads is legally registered and when government operates in an efficient manner. The legislature intends to improve the lives of all of the people who had to seek an exemption and all of the workers who do not want to tell people they cannot register their vehicles because of California motor vehicle emissions standards.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The following acts or parts of acts are each repealed:</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(1) RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.30.010'>70A.30.010</a> (Department of ecology to adopt rules to implement California motor vehicle emission standards) and 2020 c 143 s 1, 2020 c 20 s 1366, 2010 c 76 s 1, &amp; 2005 c 295 s 2; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.30.030'>70A.30.030</a> (New vehicle greenhouse gas emissions disclosure<span style=\"font-family:times new roman;\">—</span>Rule-making authority) and 2020 c 143 s 2, 2014 c 76 s 8, &amp; 2008 c 32 s 2.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 3.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70A.15'>70A.15</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->Nothing in this chapter may be interpreted to provide authority to the department to adopt any motor vehicle emissions standard of the state of California.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 4.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The department of licensing is directed to start licensing vehicles that were prohibited due to California motor vehicle emissions standards if they otherwise meet state requirements.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 5.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The department of ecology is directed to repeal any rules that implement the California motor vehicle emissions standards or were based on the statutory authority repealed in this act.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 6.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">This act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, or support of the state government and its existing public institutions, and takes effect immediately.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.1in;font-weight:bold;text-align:center;\">--- END ---</div></body></html>"

      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1117 is to remove Washington's authority to adopt California motor vehicle emissions standards. This change aims to alleviate administrative burdens on the government and citizens by allowing easier registration of vehicles that meet federal manufacturing standards. The bill addresses issues that arose from these emissions standards, which led to the need for numerous exemptions in vehicle registrations. The intention is to improve vehicle registration efficiency and reduce the difficulties faced by both individuals and the state.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Repeal of Emissions Standards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill repeals the following sections that allowed Washington to adopt California's emissions standards:<ul>\n<li>RCW 70A.30.010: Relating to the Department of Ecology's rules for implementing California motor vehicle emission standards.</li>\n<li>RCW 70A.30.030: Concerning new vehicle greenhouse gas emissions disclosures.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Limitation of Authority</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new section is added to RCW 70A.15 indicating that the Department of Ecology cannot adopt any motor vehicle emissions standards set by California.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Vehicle Registration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Licensing is mandated to begin licensing vehicles that were previously prohibited due to the California emissions standards, provided they meet state requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Rule Repeal</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Ecology is directed to repeal any rules that implemented or were influenced by the now-repealed California emissions authority.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Immediate Effect</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The act is declared necessary for the immediate preservation of public peace, health, or safety, enabling it to take effect immediately upon passage.</li>\n</ul>"
