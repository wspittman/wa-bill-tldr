The bill aims to streamline the process for offenders to earn credit for complying with their supervision terms, which can ultimately reduce their time on supervision. Key changes from the previous version include the removal of the requirement for offenders to show progress towards individualized goals and the specification of the amount of credit earned each month, which is now set at 10 days for compliant offenders.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Supervision Compliance Credit</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Offenders supervised by the Department of Corrections can earn monthly supervision compliance credit by adhering to their supervision terms.</li>\n<li>Offenders who maintain compliance will earn 10 days of credit for each month they meet the established supervision terms. </li>\n<li>Credit is accrued monthly and cannot be applied to supervision terms until it is earned.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Eligibility for Earning Credit</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Offenders are ineligible for supervision compliance credit if they:<ul>\n<li>Were sentenced under specific serious offenses as outlined in RCW 9.94A.507 or RCW 10.95.030.</li>\n<li>Were sentenced to any alternative under the provisions of this chapter.</li>\n<li>Are subject to supervision laws under RCW 9.94A.745.</li>\n<li>Are subject to a governor's conditional commutation.</li>\n<li>Have an indeterminate sentence and are on parole as per RCW 9.95.017.</li>\n<li>Are serving community custody under early release provisions outlined in RCW 9.94A.730.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>"
