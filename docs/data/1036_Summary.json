      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The primary goal of the edits made to Substitute House Bill 1036 is to refine the governance structure of college boards of trustees in Washington State by explicitly including labor representatives and clarifying the rules surrounding appointments and qualifications for trustees.
