      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The proposed House Bill 1110 seeks to amend the law regarding the vacation of convictions related to driving under the influence (DUI) and prior offenses. The main goal of the bill is to provide a process allowing individuals with these convictions to clear their records, facilitating their reintegration into society. Key changes from the previous version include the repeal of certain previous restrictions on record vacation, making it easier for eligible individuals to apply. The bill also clarifies the circumstances under which a conviction related to DUI can be vacated, which may enhance opportunities for those affected to move on from their past offenses.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Vacation of Convictions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors can apply to have their convictions vacated.</li>\n<li>Applicants must have completed all sentencing terms, including any financial obligations.</li>\n<li>The court can vacate a conviction if the applicant has no pending criminal charges and meets other specific criteria.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Conditions for Vacation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Convictions related to violent offenses are not eligible for vacation.</li>\n<li>Driving-related offenses under specific RCWs are not eligible if there have been subsequent convictions within five years.</li>\n<li>Certain categories such as domestic violence or sex offenses have additional restrictions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Special Considerations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Victims of sex trafficking or domestic violence may have their convictions vacated under specific circumstances, even if they haven't met all standard criteria.</li>\n<li>Family members of homicide victims can petition for the vacation of a conviction for prostitution related to the victim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Process for Record Updates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Upon granting a vacation, the court must inform relevant authorities to update their records, ensuring that the vacated conviction does not appear in any public criminal history.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Legal Implications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Once a conviction is vacated, individuals can legally state they have never been convicted of that crime.</li>\n<li>Certain vacated domestic violence convictions may still be considered in future prosecutions under limited circumstances.</li>\n<li>The bill specifies that it does not change the requirements for firearm possession rights.</li>\n</ul>"
