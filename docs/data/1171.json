However, if at any time the department identifies risk or safety factors that warrant an investigation under this chapter, then the family assessment response case must be reassigned to investigation;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(vi) Conduct an investigation, and not a family assessment, in response to an allegation that, the department determines based on the intake assessment:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(A) Indicates a child's health, safety, and welfare will be seriously endangered if not taken into custody for reasons including, but not limited to, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of the child as defined in this chapter;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(B) Poses a serious threat of substantial harm to a child;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(C) Constitutes conduct involving a criminal offense that has, or is about to occur, in which the child is the victim;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(D) The child is an abandoned child as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.030'>13.34.030</a>;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(E) The child is an adjudicated dependent child as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13.34.030'>13.34.030</a>, or the child is in a facility that is licensed, operated, or certified for care of children by the department under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=74.15'>74.15</a> RCW.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) In addition, the department may use a family assessment response to assess for and provide prevention and family services and programs, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020'>26.44.020</a>, for the following children and their families, consistent with requirements under the federal family first prevention services act and this section:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) A child who is a candidate for foster care, as defined in RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=26.44.020'>26.44.020</a>; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) A child who is in foster care and who is pregnant, parenting, or both.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The department may not be held civilly liable for the decision to respond to an allegation of child abuse or neglect by using the family assessment response under this section unless the state or its officers, agents, or employees acted with reckless disregard.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(13)(a) For reports of alleged abuse or neglect that are accepted for investigation by the department, the investigation shall be conducted within time frames established by the department in rule.

If the department determines that the response to the allegation will be family assessment response, the preferred practice is to request a parent's, guardian's, or custodian's permission to interview the child before conducting the child interview unless doing so would compromise the safety of the child or the integrity of the assessment. The interviews may be conducted on school premises, at day-care facilities, at the child's home, or at other suitable locations outside of the presence of parents. If the allegation is investigated, parental notification of the interview must occur at the earliest possible point in the investigation that will not jeopardize the safety or protection of the child or the course of the investigation.

The department shall maintain a log of screened-out nonabusive cases.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) In the family assessment response, the department shall not make a finding as to whether child abuse or neglect occurred. No one shall be named as a perpetrator and no investigative finding shall be entered in the department's child abuse or neglect database.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(19) The department shall use a risk assessment process when investigating alleged child abuse and neglect referrals. The department shall present the risk factors at all hearings in which the placement of a dependent child is an issue.

This change is intended to protect client confidentiality and ensure that legal representation can be conducted without the risk of unintentionally disclosing sensitive information due to reporting obligations.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Exemption from Reporting for Attorneys</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Attorney employees of higher education institutions are exempt from mandatory reporting of child abuse and neglect if the information is gained in the course of legal representation of a client. </li>\n<li>This exemption applies to both public and private institutions of higher education.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Mandated Reporting Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Other employees, including student employees in academic or athletic departments, must report suspected child abuse or neglect. </li>\n<li>Individuals who have reasonable cause to believe that a child has suffered abuse or neglect must report this to the appropriate authorities within a specific timeframe (no longer than 48 hours).</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting Process</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Reports of child abuse or neglect must include the identity of the accused, if known.</li>\n<li>Investigations of reported incidents must be conducted within a set timeframe, generally not extending beyond 90 days.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Additional Provisions for Child Protection</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The department responsible for child protective services must take action, including notifying law enforcement, based on the severity of the incident and the child's welfare.</li>\n<li>The law enforcement agency is required to provide timely notifications to relevant parties about the status and findings of reported cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Confidentiality</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The new provisions emphasize that the confidentiality of communications between attorneys and their clients must be maintained, preventing the undermining of legal representation due to reporting obligations.</li>\n<li>The bill establishes that any information deemed privileged by statute and not related directly to reporting requirements cannot be divulged without proper waiver.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Public Awareness</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The department must create and share a public poster detailing reporting requirements and the necessary actions for those required to report suspected child abuse, in both English and Spanish.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill serves to ensure that while the protection of children is paramount, the obligations of attorneys to maintain client confidentiality are also respected.</p>"

        "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The edits to the proposed legislature bill aim to clarify the exemptions for attorney employees in higher education when it comes to mandated reporting of child abuse and neglect. The original bill mandated that all employees, including attorney employees, at institutions of higher education report any suspected child abuse or neglect. The changes now specifically exempt attorneys and their supervising employees from reporting obligations if the information was obtained through the legal representation of a client. This change seeks to uphold the confidentiality between attorneys and clients, thereby ensuring that clients receive adequate legal representation without the risk of compulsory reporting overriding their rights.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Exemption Clarifications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The edited bill adds specific exemptions for:<ul>\n<li>Attorneys employed by institutions of higher education regarding information gained during the legal representation of clients. </li>\n<li>Employees working under the supervision of these attorneys, as it relates to the same confidential information.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Language and Structure Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Some wording has been adjusted to refine the meanings without altering the intent, such as:<ul>\n<li>Changing \"supervise law students in clinical practices where such students are inadvertently required to disclose information\" to \"supervise law students in clinical practices where such students are inadvertently required to disclose information related to the representation of a client.\"</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Consolidation of Reporting Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The overall structure regarding the responsibilities for reporting suspected abuse is maintained, but the exemptions for attorneys help delineate their obligations more clearly.</li>\n<li>Stipulations around when reports must be made and the definitions used (e.g., \"severe abuse\") remain consistent with the original bill.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>These edits aim to balance the critical need for reporting child abuse and neglect with the essential legal principle of client confidentiality. The changes make it clearer under what circumstances attorney employees at educational institutions are exempt from mandatory reporting, thus providing more clarity and protecting the attorney-client relationship.</p>"
