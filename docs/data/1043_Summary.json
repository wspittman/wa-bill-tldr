      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1043 is to amend existing laws regarding tax credits for commute trip reduction in Washington State. The bill aims to extend the deadlines for these tax credits from 2025 to 2035, increasing the maximum possible tax credit from $60 to $100 per employee per fiscal year. This change is designed to encourage employers and property managers to provide financial incentives for their employees to use more sustainable forms of commuting, such as ride sharing, public transportation, car sharing, and nonmotorized commuting. The amendment seeks to broaden the impact of the tax credits and support environmental initiatives.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Tax Credit Amounts</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Employers providing financial incentives for sustainable commuting methods can earn a tax credit up to $100 per employee per fiscal year.</li>\n<li>Property managers offering similar incentives to employees can also receive a tax credit up to $100 per individual per fiscal year.</li>\n<li>The credit equals 50% of the amount paid to or on behalf of each employee, capped at $100.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Credit Limitations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The total amount of tax credits awarded by the state may not exceed $4,300,000 in any fiscal year. If applications exceed this limit, credits will be reduced proportionately.</li>\n<li>Tax credits cannot be claimed if they exceed the total tax owed under applicable tax laws.</li>\n<li>Individuals cannot receive credits for the same expense claimed by someone else, and no refunds are granted for credits.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Expiration and Extension</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill extends the expiration date of the tax credits from July 1, 2025, to July 1, 2035, allowing continued support for commute trip reduction efforts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Additional Sections</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new section states that certain prior regulations (RCW 82.32.808) do not apply to this act, indicating a specificity to this bill.</li>\n<li>The act is determined crucial for public health, safety, and governmental support, with an effective date of July 1, 2025.</li>\n</ul>"
