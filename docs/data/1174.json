      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1174 is to enhance the provision of court interpreters for individuals with limited English proficiency. The bill aims to ensure that these individuals can fully understand and participate in legal proceedings by requiring the appointment of credentialed interpreters. Key changes from the previous version of the law include a shift from requiring \"qualified interpreters\" to requiring \"credentialed interpreters,\" as well as stricter guidelines for interpreter appointments based on availability and necessity, thereby improving language access in the judicial system.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Interpreter Appointment Procedures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Credentialed interpreters must be appointed for legal proceedings involving persons with limited English proficiency unless good cause is documented for using a non-credentialed interpreter.</li>\n<li>\"Good cause\" includes circumstances where a credentialed interpreter is not reasonably available or does not speak the necessary language.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Interpreter Qualifications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill establishes that interpreters must be credentialed by the Administrative Office of the Courts and take an oath affirming their commitment to accurately interpret proceedings.</li>\n<li>The court is required to verify that the interpreter is capable of communicating effectively in English and the relevant language, and has agreed to adhere to a recognized code of professional responsibility for interpreters.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Language Access Plans</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Each court must develop and maintain a language access plan detailing how they will provide interpreter services for individuals with limited English proficiency.</li>\n<li>Plans should include procedures to identify language needs, appoint interpreters, and inform court users of their rights regarding interpreter services.</li>\n<li>Courts are required to submit their language access plans to the Administrative Office of the Courts for approval and maintain these plans updated biennially.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Interpreter Costs and Funding</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill stipulates that a person with limited English proficiency involved in a legal proceeding is not responsible for the interpreter's costs if they are a party to the case, subpoenaed, or compelled to appear.</li>\n<li>Costs for providing interpreters in government-initiated proceedings will be covered by the governmental body responsible for the action.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Training and Development</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Administrative Office of the Courts will establish a credentialing program for interpreters and provide suitable training programs to ensure a sufficient supply of credentialed interpreters.</li>\n<li>Various standards for proficiency in both English and the languages being interpreted will be set forth.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Additional Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new section mandates that the court must appoint a team of interpreters as required by supreme court rules to facilitate complex proceedings.</li>\n<li>Courts must also ensure that translated information and resources about interpreter services are made available in multiple languages on their websites, enhancing public accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill represents a comprehensive approach to ensuring equitable access to justice for individuals with limited English proficiency in Washington State's legal system.</p>"

The changes focus on the terms used to describe interpreters and the rights of individuals requiring interpretation. This amendment seeks to ensure that individuals who cannot communicate effectively in English are adequately supported in legal contexts, thereby improving access to justice.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Terminology Updates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Replacement of Terms:</strong><ul>\n<li>The term \"qualified interpreters\" has been removed in favor of \"credentialed interpreters,\" emphasizing the qualifications necessary for interpreters in legal settings.</li>\n<li>\"Non-English-speaking person\" has been changed to \"person with limited English proficiency\" to better reflect the needs of individuals relying on interpretation services.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Appointment and Responsibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interpreter Appointment:</strong><ul>\n<li>The bill clarifies that credentialed interpreters must be appointed for individuals with limited English proficiency unless a valid reason (good cause) is given for using a non-credentialed interpreter.</li>\n<li>The definition of “good cause” has been broadened to reinforce the circumstances under which a non-credentialed interpreter may be considered.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Rights and Waivers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Rights to Interpretation:</strong><ul>\n<li>A person's right to an interpreter cannot be waived without clear documentation that the waiver is made voluntarily and with full understanding.</li>\n<li>The language has been updated to emphasize that the waiver of the right to an interpreter can be reconsidered during proceedings.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Language Access Plans</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Development and Maintenance:</strong><ul>\n<li>Courts are now required to develop and maintain a written language access plan that includes specific provisions for how they will provide interpreter services and communicate available services to the public effectively.</li>\n<li>Plans should be evaluated regularly, ensuring they meet the ongoing needs of individuals with limited English proficiency.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Financial Responsibilities</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Interpreter Costs:</strong><ul>\n<li>The bill specifies that court-mandated classes can utilize interpreters without requiring them to be court-credentialed, allowing flexibility in interpreter use while ensuring individuals with limited English proficiency are not responsible for interpreter costs in various scenarios, such as being a party in legal proceedings or compelled to appear in court.</li>\n<li>Defines the reimbursement process whereby the state can assist in covering costs for interpreter services provided in court.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes seek to create a more comprehensive and user-friendly approach to court interpretation, ensuring that language barriers do not impede individuals’ access to the legal system.</p>"
