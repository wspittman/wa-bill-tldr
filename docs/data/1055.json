The legislature finds that residents of Washington have every right to know how their elected officials and government agencies come to critical decisions which impact their livelihoods so greatly. Barriers to accessing these records only act as a disservice to the public. The legislature further intends to build upon the foundation set by the voters through their adoption of Initiative Measure No. 276, also known as the public records act, by ensuring individuals have an independent advocate holding lawmakers and public agencies accountable as stewards of official public records.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) Subject to the availability of amounts appropriated for this specific purpose, the joint legislative audit and review committee, in coordination with the joint legislative committee on transparency established under section 3 of this act, a representative from the office of the attorney general who works in the area of open government, and the public records exemptions accountability committee created under RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=42.56.140'>42.56.140</a>, shall conduct a study on the efficacy of establishing the Washington office of transparency ombuds as an independent state agency to assist individuals with accessing public records.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(2) At a minimum, the study must:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Include a comprehensive overview and comparison of each state's public records laws, right to know laws, open government laws, or other substantially related laws which seek to provide public access to government-produced or maintained records.
