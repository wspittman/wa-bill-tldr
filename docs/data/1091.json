      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1091 is to amend existing laws regarding sexually violent predators and their ability to earn supervision compliance credit. The bill proposes to make certain offenders ineligible for such credits, which can help reduce their supervision period based on compliance with set conditions. Key changes include the clarification of specific offenses and conditions under which offenders will not qualify for earning compliance credits, aiming to enhance public safety by maintaining stricter oversight of these individuals.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Changes to Eligibility for Supervision Compliance Credit</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Offenders are no longer eligible to earn supervision compliance credit if they:<ul>\n<li>Were sentenced under specific regulations (RCW 9.94A.507 or 10.95.030).</li>\n<li>Were sentenced under additional specified regulations (RCW 9.94A.650, 9.94A.655, 9.94A.660, or 9.94A.670).</li>\n<li>Are subject to supervision under RCW 9.94A.745.</li>\n<li>Have an indeterminate sentence and are eligible for parole (RCW 9.95.017).</li>\n<li>Are serving community custody under early release (RCW 9.94A.730).</li></ul></li>\n<li>Offenders are also ineligible for compliance credit for any time served concurrently with less restrictive alternatives subject to supervision (RCW 71.09.092). </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This adjustment emphasizes the state's focus on accountability for sexually violent predators and aims to reinforce supervision procedures.</p>"
