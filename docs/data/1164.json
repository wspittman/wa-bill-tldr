The bill aims to ensure that any parcel of land adjacent to or across the street from a residential area with urban services can be developed for housing. This change is intended to manage housing supply without placing additional costs on local governments.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Urban Growth Area Expansion</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities and counties must expand urban growth area boundaries to include parcels that:<ul>\n<li>Share a border with a residential parcel that is developed or has been approved for development and has access to urban services.</li>\n<li>Are near roads adjacent to urban growth boundaries with residential parcels that meet similar criteria.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Restrictions on Expansion</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Urban growth area boundaries cannot include:<ul>\n<li>Critical areas or buffers, except for certain aquifer recharge areas.</li>\n<li>Sole source aquifers designated by the EPA.</li>\n<li>Impaired watershed areas.</li>\n<li>Urban separators established under planning policies.</li>\n<li>Newly created lots from splitting a single residential lot.</li>\n<li>Long-term agricultural, forest, or mineral resource designated lands.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Development Authorization</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Development on qualifying parcels must follow the same density and service regulations as the adjacent residential parcels, including access to urban services.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Planning and Review Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties must include all qualifying parcels within urban growth areas during their comprehensive plan updates.</li>\n<li>Cities located in these counties must revise plans to accommodate urban growth projections and new parcels.</li>\n<li>This includes a commitment to regular review of urban growth areas and development densities to match population growth expectations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Floodplain Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Urban growth area expansions into 100-year floodplains are generally prohibited, with specific exceptions for contained areas or where public services cannot be provided outside the floodplain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Implementation Progress Reports</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties and cities must report on their implementation progress regarding comprehensive plans related to urban growth areas, focusing on housing availability and regulatory actions every five years.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Consultation with Tribes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties must engage in meaningful consultation with affected tribal governments regarding urban growth area revisions, discussing cultural impacts and treaty rights.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These provisions collectively aim to manage residential development more effectively while considering environmental sustainability and community needs.</p>"
