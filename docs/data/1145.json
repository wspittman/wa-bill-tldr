      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1145 is to establish new reporting requirements for counties regarding public works activities. This bill aims to enhance accountability and transparency by mandating counties to collect and maintain detailed records of public works activities, especially regarding the removal of natural materials. The key change from prior regulations is the introduction of specific data points that counties must document, thereby impacting how such activities are reported and monitored.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Record Keeping Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties must collect and keep records for any public works activity they undertake.</li>\n<li>The records must include at minimum:<ul>\n<li>The amount of soil, trees, shrubs, gravel, or other natural or organic materials removed if more than a de minimis amount.</li>\n<li>Details on where the removed materials were taken and how they were disposed of.</li>\n<li>Information on whether any of the removed materials were reused for other projects.</li>\n<li>Results from any tests performed on the materials for contaminants.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definitions for Clarity</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\"De minimis amount\" is defined as a quantity of natural or organic material that is too small to be easily noticed without detailed examination.</li>\n<li>\"Public works activity\" refers to any maintenance or construction activities conducted by the county on a county road that is on or near privately owned property.</li>\n</ul>"
