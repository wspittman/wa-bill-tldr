The updated version shifts the focus of design review processes and emphasizes the need for more accessibility in housing development, including clear guidelines for affordable housing. The changes serve to streamline these processes, promote inclusivity, and ensure efficient compliance with state laws regarding land use and development.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>General Updates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>amended sections now include RCW 36.70A.030</strong> alongside the original RCWs, indicating a broader scope of regulation.</li>\n<li>An emphasis on <strong>\"active transportation\"</strong> was added to define active modes of transportation, enhancing the focus on pedestrian mobility and related infrastructure.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definitions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>New Definitions</strong>: Several new definitions were introduced to clarify terms used throughout the legislation, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>“Active transportation”</strong> and <strong>“active transportation facilities”</strong> to promote pedestrian and cycling infrastructure.</li>\n<li><strong>“Administrative design review”</strong> describes a streamlined process for reviewing and approving design standards.</li></ul></li>\n<li><p><strong>Affordable Housing</strong>: Revised definitions of <strong>\"affordable housing\"</strong> provide clear income thresholds, ensuring the legislation addresses varied affordability concerns within residential developments.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Design Review Process</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The structure of the <strong>\"design review\"</strong> process was clarified to ensure that any review must comply with clear and objective standards, simplifying the evaluation for developers.</li>\n<li>Provisions were added to specify that <strong>only one design concept</strong> needs to be submitted before reviewing a housing development permit, which is a significant relaxation of previous requirements.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Housing Development</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The definition of <strong>\"housing development\"</strong> was expanded to include <strong>middle housing</strong>, indicating a shift towards promoting more diverse housing options.</li>\n<li>Cities are now required to <strong>allow a variety of middle housing types</strong>, which include duplexes, triplexes, and others, thus facilitating compact and diverse communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Implementation and Compliance</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The timeline for cities to comply with the new requirements was clarified, ensuring that regulatory changes are implemented within defined timeframes.</li>\n<li>Updated rules specify conditions under which cities must provide affordable housing units, removing barriers to housing development while still allowing for individualized requirements based on local needs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Exemptions and Exceptions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Specific provisions exempt certain geographic areas from new density requirements to protect critical regions and maintain public safety, ensuring careful development consideration in sensitive areas.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes collectively aim to modernize and make local governance around design review and housing development more responsive to community needs and state growth targets.</p>"
