      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1070 is to amend industrial insurance coverage to include posttraumatic stress disorders (PTSD) for correctional facility workers. This bill seeks to address mental health concerns for those who work in correctional settings, enhancing their access to compensation for occupational diseases related to stress. Key changes include establishing a rebuttable presumption that PTSD is an occupational disease for these workers after they have been employed for a minimum of 90 consecutive days. This represents a shift from previous rules where stress-related claims were largely excluded from occupational disease definitions.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Amendments to Mental Health Claims</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department will adopt a rule clarifying that claims for mental conditions caused by stress generally do not qualify as occupational diseases, with exemptions outlined for certain professions.</li>\n<li>PTSD claims for firefighters and public safety telecommunicators hired after specific dates require prior psychological exams that rule out pre-existing conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Presumptive Coverage for Correctional Facility Workers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Correctional facility workers are presumed to have occupational disease status for PTSD developed after 90 days of employment.</li>\n<li>This presumption can be challenged by presenting evidence that disputes the claim.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Post-Employment Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The PTSD presumption extends for up to three months for each year worked, not exceeding 60 months following the last date of employment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Appeals and Costs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If claims regarding the PTSD presumption are appealed and decided in favor of the worker, all reasonable costs, including attorney fees, are covered for the claimant by the opposing party.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definition of Correctional Facility Worker</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill stipulates that a \"correctional facility worker\" refers to individuals employed in correctional facilities, as outlined by existing definitions in state law. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Effective Date</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The provisions of this act will go into effect on January 1, 2026.</li>\n</ul>"
