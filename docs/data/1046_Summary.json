      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this bill is to protect individuals who rescue vulnerable persons or domestic animals from being sued for any damage they may cause to a motor vehicle during the rescue. The bill aims to encourage people to take action in emergencies without worrying about potential legal consequences. The main change in this proposed bill is the establishment of specific conditions under which rescuers can gain immunity from civil liability when they forcibly enter a locked vehicle to provide assistance.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Immunity from Civil Liability</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person who enters a locked motor vehicle to rescue a vulnerable person or domestic animal is protected from civil liability for damages if they:<ul>\n<li>Confirm that the vehicle is locked or that the person or animal cannot exit without help.</li>\n<li>Have a reasonable belief that the person or animal is in imminent danger of harm.</li>\n<li>Notify law enforcement or call 911 before or immediately after entering the vehicle.</li>\n<li>Use only necessary force to enter the vehicle and remove the individual or animal.</li>\n<li>Stay with the rescued person or animal in a safe location near the vehicle until help arrives.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>"
