      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1080 is to ensure transparency in the pricing of lodging accommodations by requiring that all fees or charges be clearly disclosed in the advertised rates for hotels and short-term rentals. This bill aims to protect consumers from hidden fees by mandating that total prices include all government-imposed taxes and fees before any reservation is made. The significant change from previous legislation is the explicit requirement for full transparency in pricing and the introduction of penalties for violations.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Hotel Fees Disclosure</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All fees or charges for hotel stays must be included in the advertised room rate, excluding only government-imposed taxes and fees.</li>\n<li>Hotels must provide the total price, inclusive of taxes and fees, before a consumer reserves their stay.</li>\n<li>This requirement applies to all advertisements, displays, or offers for hotel stays, both within Washington State and from there to other states.</li>\n<li>Penalties: A violation can lead to a civil penalty of up to $10,000 per instance, enforceable by city attorneys, county prosecuting attorneys, or the attorney general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Short-Term Rental Fees Disclosure</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All fees or charges for short-term rentals must also be included in the advertised rate, except for taxes and government fees.</li>\n<li>Total prices provided to guests for short-term rentals must include all applicable taxes and fees prior to reservation.</li>\n<li>Similar to hotels, this provision applies to all related advertisements, displays, or offers within and outside the state.</li>\n<li>Penalties: A violation can result in a civil penalty of up to $10,000, with enforcement options similar to those for hotels.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Effective Date</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The act is set to take effect on July 1, 2025, as it is considered necessary for the protection of public peace, health, safety, or the support of state government and its public institutions.</li>\n</ul>"

      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The edits to this proposed legislature bill aim to enhance transparency regarding fees associated with lodging accommodations, specifically for hotels and short-term rentals. The key change is the inclusion of \"assessment fees of a government-created special district or program\" in the disclosure requirements, ensuring that consumers are informed of all costs before reserving a stay. This adjustment is intended to protect consumers from hidden fees, thereby promoting fairer practices in the lodging industry.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Changes in Fee Disclosure Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All required fees for hotels must now include:<ul>\n<li>Assessment fees of a government-created special district or program, in addition to other government-imposed taxes and fees.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Before reserving a hotel stay, consumers must see the total price that incorporates:<ul>\n<li>All taxes and government-imposed fees, as well as assessment fees from special districts or programs.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Administrative Changes</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill is now introduced as a \"Substitute House Bill,\" implying modifications were made during the legislative process.</li>\n<li>The date of the first reading has changed from January 13, 2025, to February 17, 2025.</li>\n<li>The sponsoring entity has shifted from individual representatives to the \"House Consumer Protection &amp; Business\" committee.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, these changes broaden the scope of fee transparency, making it more comprehensive for consumers engaging with both hotels and short-term rentals.</p>"
