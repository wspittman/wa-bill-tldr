      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1034 is to ensure that health plans in Washington State do not impose unfair restrictions on nonopioid drugs used for pain management. Starting January 1, 2026, health plans and managed care organizations must treat nonopioid alternatives more equitably when compared to opioid medications. The bill aims to promote the use of nonopioid treatments to combat the rising issues of opioid dependency and misuse by preventing discrimination against nonopioid drugs in coverage and management practices.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Health Plan Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Health plans issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2026, cannot:<ul>\n<li>Designate nonopioid drugs as nonpreferred if an opioid drug is preferred.</li>\n<li>Impose stricter requirements (such as prior authorization or step therapy) on nonopioid drugs than those applied to opioids.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Managed Care Organizations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Managed care organizations must adhere to the same regulations as health plans, ensuring that nonopioid drugs are not disadvantaged starting January 1, 2026. They also need to comply with the outlined practices of equitability.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Education and Resources</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>By January 1, 2026, the Department of Health is required to develop and publish an educational pamphlet about nonopioid alternatives. This pamphlet must include:<ul>\n<li>Information on available nonopioid alternatives for pain treatment, including medications and non-drug therapies.</li>\n<li>The pros and cons of using nonopioid treatments.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Existing Laws</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustments are made to established regulations regarding prescription drug utilization management to align with the provisions of nonopioid drug treatment, ensuring consistent application across health practices.</li>\n</ul>"
