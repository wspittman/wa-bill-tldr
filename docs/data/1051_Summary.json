      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1051 is to give parents or guardians the right to audio record their child's individualized education program (IEP) team meetings. This change allows families to better participate in the educational planning process and ensures they have a clear record of discussions about their child's needs. The bill amends existing laws to clarify when and how recordings of these meetings can be made, balancing the rights of parents with the existing laws on recordings.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Parental Rights to Record</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Parents or guardians of a student can audio record IEP team meetings without needing consent from other participants.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compliance for Team Members</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Other members of the IEP team must adhere to existing state law (RCW 9.73.030) regarding recording, except when it comes to the rights granted to parents in the previous point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Existing Law</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill modifies RCW 9.73.030 to clarify that it does not apply to recordings made by parents or guardians during IEP team meetings, ensuring these recordings are permissible and not subject to the same consent requirements as other communications.</li>\n</ul>"
