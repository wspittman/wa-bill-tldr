These approaches include establishing success teams that regularly review data regarding student attendance, behavior, and grades to identify when a student may be falling behind and intervene with strategic supports. Through coaching and collaboration these success teams also share best practices, evaluate outcome data, and progress towards creating a sustainable framework that can be implemented in subsequent school years.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">The legislature acknowledges the impact of the ninth grade success team pilot program established in 2019, which resulted in four out of five school districts reporting immediate and sustained increases in their ninth grade on-track rates. The program has expanded to 68 participating schools in the 2024-25 school year, and a recent evaluation has shown that participating schools through the 2023-24 school year have on-track rates that are 6.69 percentage points higher than comparison schools.
