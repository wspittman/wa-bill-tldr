      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this bill is to ensure that individuals convicted of a hit and run resulting in death are excluded from eligibility for a first-time offender waiver under Washington law. This change aims to address the severity of such offenses and prevent leniency in sentencing for offenders in these cases. The key change from the previous law is the explicit addition of hit and run resulting in death as a disqualifying offense for first-time offender status, making it clear that this crime is not treated with the same leniency as other less severe felonies.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Eligibility for First-Time Offender Waiver</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals convicted of hit and run resulting in death under RCW 46.52.020(4)(a) are not eligible for a first-time offender waiver.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Conditions of Sentencing</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Courts can waive the standard sentence for eligible first-time offenders, with an alternative sentence including up to ninety days of confinement.</li>\n<li>The court may impose up to six months of community custody, extendable in cases of ordered treatment, not to exceed one year.</li>\n<li>Offenders placed under community custody may be required to pay legal financial obligations and perform community restitution work as part of their sentence.</li>\n</ul>"
