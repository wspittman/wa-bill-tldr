Accessory dwelling units are especially needed in rural communities that do not yet have the infrastructure for larger scale development.

      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The goal of this bill is to address Washington's housing crisis by encouraging the construction of affordable housing through detached accessory dwelling units (ADUs) in rural areas. The bill emphasizes the need for an additional 1.1 million homes by 2044. It seeks to create pathways for the development of ADUs, which are seen as a fast and effective way to provide affordable housing options, particularly in areas lacking the infrastructure for larger developments.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Authorization for Detached ADUs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Counties are permitted to allow detached accessory dwelling units in rural areas on lots of any size.</li>\n<li>This authorization can override existing county comprehensive plans, countywide planning policies, or multicounty planning policies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Requirements for Detached ADUs</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A parcel can have only one accessory dwelling unit, which can be either attached or detached.</li>\n<li>The water supply for the ADU must meet specific requirements:<ul>\n<li>Cannot use a water source that is closed to further appropriation.</li>\n<li>Must access water from the primary dwelling's water right.</li>\n<li>Water usage must be metered for each dwelling unit.</li></ul></li>\n<li>ADUs must not encroach upon buffers around critical areas.</li>\n<li>Documentation must prove existing sewage or septic systems can manage additional demands from the ADU.</li>\n<li>If connected to an existing septic system, an inspection must be performed by a licensed contractor before permit issuance.</li>\n<li>The maximum floor area allowed for the ADU is 1,296 square feet, excluding garages, porches, and unfinished basements.</li>\n<li>ADUs must use exterior materials and designs that are similar to the primary dwelling unless the ADU is a mobile home or manufactured home.</li>\n<li>The ADU must share the same driveway as the primary dwelling.</li>\n<li>Siting of the ADU must avoid loss of designated agricultural or forest land.</li>\n<li>Parcels cannot be subdivided to circumvent development limitations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compliance and Implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Any county planning to authorize ADUs in rural areas must update its comprehensive plan during its next scheduled update to reflect this legislation.</li>\n<li>Population growth resulting from ADUs that comply with these provisions will not count against a county's rural or urban growth targets.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Existing Laws</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill amends several existing RCWs to integrate the provisions for detached ADUs and ensure compatibility with current regulations.</li>\n<li>The definitions of relevant terms such as accessory dwelling unit, city, county, and owner are updated to include these new provisions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>By implementing these changes, the bill aims to provide more affordable housing options throughout rural Washington, thus alleviating some aspects of the state's housing crisis.</p>"
