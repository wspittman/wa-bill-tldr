      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1048 is to implement a pilot project for rangeland fire protection associations in Washington, particularly in eastern Washington, to improve wildfire management. The bill intends to assess how these associations can utilize local knowledge and resources to enhance initial firefighting efforts, promoting community involvement in wildfire prevention and suppression. Key changes from previous regulations include the establishment of specific requirements for these associations, including safety, training, and operational guidelines, which aim to ensure effective and coordinated wildfire responses. The pilot project is designed to last five years, evaluating the effectiveness of local associations in managing wildfires.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Pilot Project Implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Department of Natural Resources will conduct the pilot project from 2026 to 2029 in eastern Washington.</li>\n<li>The project aims to assess the operational and safety measures needed for rangeland fire protection associations.</li>\n<li>Annual reports on the pilot's effectiveness, focusing on safety, training, funding, governance, and operations, will be submitted to the legislature.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Association Operations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Rangeland fire protection associations can enter agreements with local fire protection agencies for wildfire management.</li>\n<li>Associations must comply with safety and management guidelines established by the Department of Natural Resources.</li>\n<li>Each association must have liability insurance and can operate within designated service boundaries, including temporarily extending to protected areas during wildfires.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Membership Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Members of these associations must be at least 18 years old and possess the necessary wildland fire training, specifically achieving Wildland Firefighter 2 certification.</li>\n<li>Members must use personal protective equipment that conforms to established safety standards during firefighting activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Duration and Expiration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All provisions linked to rangeland fire protection associations and the pilot project will expire on June 30, 2030.</li>\n</ul>"
