      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1065 is to establish clear regulations for family burial grounds on privately-owned land in Washington State. The bill introduces guidelines for designating family burial grounds, which allow individuals to bury human remains on their property under specific conditions. Key changes include detailing the requirements for establishing such grounds, prohibiting the sale of burial plots, and implementing a recording process for burials on private property. The bill aims to provide a legal framework that respects personal and family burial practices while maintaining public safety and accountability.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Establishment of Family Burial Grounds</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A natural person can designate privately owned land as a family burial ground.</li>\n<li>For co-owned property, written consent from all co-owners is required to establish a family burial ground.</li>\n<li>Family burial grounds cannot exist on properties co-owned by both individuals and legal entities.</li>\n<li>The burial ground must be at least 25 feet from property boundaries and cannot be:<ul>\n<li>Within 150 feet of designated critical areas.</li>\n<li>Within 50 feet of existing easements or public rights-of-way.</li></ul></li>\n<li>The area designated as a family burial ground must not exceed 10% of the total parcel size.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Prohibition on Sales and Fees</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Property owners cannot sell burial plots or charge fees for goods or services related to the family burial ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Recording Burials</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Property owners must record each burial within 30 days with the county auditor, providing specific details such as the deceased's name, dates of birth and death, property information, and the grave's latitude and longitude coordinates.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Disclosure Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Property owners must inform potential buyers about the existence of a family burial ground before selling the property.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Local Regulation Authority</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities and counties can create ordinances to regulate or prohibit the establishment of family burial grounds and allow local planning commissions to make recommendations regarding this issue.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Amendments to Existing Laws</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill amends several existing laws, clarifying that regulations designed for public cemeteries do not apply to family burial grounds established under the provisions of this act.</li>\n</ul>"
