      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The edits made to the proposed bill aim to clarify and expand on the parking regulations specific to residential neighborhoods in Washington State. The changes primarily focus on providing greater flexibility for residential property owners concerning parking arrangements. A notable introduction in the edited version is the allowance for property owners to park across their own driveway, provided specific conditions are met. This aims to strike a balance between facilitating parking and maintaining roadway safety.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Specification of Sponsors and Legislative Details</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill is now attributed to \"House Transportation\" instead of individual sponsors.</li>\n<li>The \"READ FIRST TIME\" date has been changed from 01/13/25 to 02/03/25.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Changes in Parking Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjustments have been made to the allowances for parking in front of driveways:<ul>\n<li>The new version specifies that residential property owners may park across the point of ingress or egress of their driveway, as long as the driveway does not exceed 50 feet and parking does not obstruct sidewalks, another driveway, or the roadway.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Revisions of Measurement Standards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All previously stated distances where parking was restricted (e.g., 15 feet from a fire hydrant, 20 feet from a crosswalk) have had their textual references changed from written numbers to numerical forms:<ul>\n<li>\"fifteen\" to \"15\"</li>\n<li>\"twenty\" to \"20\"</li>\n<li>\"thirty\" to \"30\"</li>\n<li>\"fifty\" to \"50\"</li>\n<li>\"seventy-five\" to \"75\"</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This improves consistency in the document, ensuring that all measurements are uniformly presented.</p>\n<h3>Additional Notes</h3>\n<p>Overall, the changes in the edited version enhance the bill's clarity while providing additional allowances for residents, promoting more effective use of parking space while ensuring that safety regulations remain intact.</p>"
