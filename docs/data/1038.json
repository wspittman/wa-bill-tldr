      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1038 is to prohibit certain medical treatments aimed at altering a minor’s gender or sex characteristics. Specifically, the bill seeks to prevent healthcare providers from prescribing puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and performing gender transition surgeries for individuals under 18 years old. This legislative change is aimed at protecting minors from medical interventions that are believed to be irreversible and potentially harmful. The bill outlines exceptions for certain medical conditions but generally restricts procedures related to gender transition.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Prohibitions on Medical Practices</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Healthcare providers licensed in Washington cannot perform the following on minors for gender transition purposes:<ul>\n<li>Prescribing or administering puberty blockers or other hormones that suppress normal puberty.</li>\n<li>Prescribing or administering testosterone, estrogen, or progesterone in amounts exceeding natural hormonal levels for individuals' age and sex.</li>\n<li>Performing surgeries that sterilize, such as:<ul>\n<li>Castration</li>\n<li>Vasectomy</li>\n<li>Hysterectomy</li>\n<li>Oophorectomy</li>\n<li>Orchiectomy</li>\n<li>Penectomy</li></ul></li>\n<li>Performing surgeries that create genitalia that differs from the individual's biological sex, including:<ul>\n<li>Metoidioplasty</li>\n<li>Phalloplasty</li>\n<li>Vaginoplasty</li></ul></li>\n<li>Removing healthy or non-diseased body parts or tissues.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Exceptions to Prohibitions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The following services are exempt from the prohibitions:<ul>\n<li>Treatments for minors with medically verifiable disorders of sex development.</li>\n<li>Services for minors diagnosed with a disorder of sexual development by a physician based on genetic or biochemical testing.</li>\n<li>Tapering off therapy from puberty-blocking medications or other hormones.</li>\n<li>Treatment of infections, injuries, diseases, or disorders caused or worsened by gender transition procedures, regardless of compliance with laws.</li>\n<li>Procedures necessary to address physical conditions that pose imminent danger of death or serious bodily impairment, certified by a physician.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>"
