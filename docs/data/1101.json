A vehicular homicide committed while under the influence or in a reckless manner is currently classified as a violent offense, making it ineligible for a first-time offender waiver. However, the Washington state courts have held that a vehicular homicide committed with disregard for the safety of others is not a violent offense. This distinction is inconsistent with the fact that all forms of vehicular homicide are categorized as class A felonies and has resulted in a loophole where some vehicular homicide convictions may be sentenced more leniently despite resulting in the same unconscionable loss of life.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature therefore intends to designate that vehicular homicide committed under any circumstances is a violent offense.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.030'>9.94A.030</a> and 2022 c 231 s 11 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->Unless the context clearly requires otherwise, the definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) \"Board\" means the indeterminate sentence review board created under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.95'>9.95</a> RCW.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) \"Collect,\" or any derivative thereof, \"collect and remit,\" or \"collect and deliver,\" when used with reference to the department, means that the department, either directly or through a collection agreement authorized by RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9.94A.760'>9.94A.760</a>, is responsible for monitoring and enforcing the offender's sentence with regard to the legal financial obligation, receiving payment thereof from the offender, and, consistent with current law, delivering daily the entire payment to the superior court clerk without depositing it in a departmental account.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) \"Commission\" means the sentencing guidelines commission.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(4) \"Community corrections officer\" means an employee of the department who is responsible for carrying out specific duties in supervision of sentenced offenders and monitoring of sentence conditions.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(5) \"Community custody\" means that portion of an offender's sentence of confinement in lieu of earned release time or imposed as part of a sentence under this chapter and served in the community subject to controls placed on the offender's movement and activities by the department.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(6) \"Community protection zone\" means the area within 880 feet of the facilities and grounds of a public or private school.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(7) \"Community restitution\" means compulsory service, without compensation, performed for the benefit of the community by the offender.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(8) \"Confinement\" means total or partial confinement.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(9) \"Conviction\" means an adjudication of guilt pursuant to Title <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=10'>10</a> or <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=13'>13</a> RCW and includes a verdict of guilty, a finding of guilty, and acceptance of a plea of guilty.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(10) \"Crime-related prohibition\" means an order of a court prohibiting conduct that directly relates to the circumstances of the crime for which the offender has been convicted, and shall not be construed to mean orders directing an offender affirmatively to participate in rehabilitative programs or to otherwise perform affirmative conduct.

The original bill classified vehicular homicide committed while under the influence or recklessly as a violent offense, while allowing vehicular homicide committed with disregard for safety to be considered non-violent. The edited bill seeks to ensure that all forms of vehicular homicide are treated as violent offenses, thereby preventing lighter sentences for such crimes. Overall, this change aims to strengthen accountability in cases of vehicular homicide.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>New Section Introduced</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new section was created to outline the legislature's findings regarding vehicular homicide.</li>\n<li>It states that vehicular homicide can occur under three different circumstances: while under the influence, in a reckless manner, or with disregard for the safety of others.</li>\n<li>The section highlights the inconsistency in how these different types are treated in current sentencing law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Classification Change</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The edited bill mandates that all forms of vehicular homicide be designated as violent offenses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Section Renumbering</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The original Section 1 has been renumbered to Section 2.</li>\n<li>Existing definitions and amendments to RCW 9.94A.030 are retained but are now in the updated context of the new section.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Expiration and Effective Dates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The expiration date for Section 2 is now listed as January 1, 2026.</li>\n<li>The effective date for the changes made to Section 3, previously known as Section 4, is also set for January 1, 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes serve to enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the law, ensuring that all instances of vehicular homicide are treated consistently under the violent offenses category, thereby promoting more just outcomes in the judicial process.</p>"
