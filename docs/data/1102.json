Veterans service officers serve a critical role in assisting veterans and their families with identifying and applying for federal benefits, including health care, service-connected disability, nonservice-connected pension, employment, education, housing, burial, and survival benefits. The federal department of veterans affairs provides over $6.5 billion per year in benefits to veterans in Washington. The average veteran receiving service-connected disability compensation benefits receives over $1,700 per month.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that nationwide, approximately 32 percent of veterans receive federal disability compensation. Washington currently has approximately 530,000 resident veterans, but only 158,000 veterans are receiving federal benefits. Currently, veterans in 15 Washington counties receive benefits at or above the national average, 21 counties are within 10 percent of the national average, and three counties are more than 10 percent below the national average.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore, the legislature intends to expand the veterans service officer program started in 2019 to increase the number of veterans applying for and receiving federal benefits. The program's first veterans service officer assisting veterans in the identification of benefits and filing of claims increased the number of veterans applying for benefits from 13 in the first year to 323 in the third year, and from no annual disability payments to $2,696,524 in federal benefits each year. The Washington state department of veterans affairs' September 30, 2024, veterans service officer program report estimates the cost to expand the program is $160,000 per year for each additional county. The legislature intends to expand the program by one to two veterans service officers per biennium beginning with the counties with the lowest percentage of benefits received, until all counties are at or above the national average.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.60A'>43.60A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The department must support veterans by providing information regarding available veterans services.

Veterans service officers serve a critical role in assisting veterans and their families with identifying and applying for federal benefits, including health care, service-connected disability, nonservice-connected pension, employment, education, housing, burial, and survival benefits. The federal department of veterans affairs provides over $6.5 billion per year in benefits to veterans in Washington. The average veteran receiving service-connected disability compensation benefits receives over $1,700 per month.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The legislature further finds that nationwide, approximately 32 percent of veterans receive federal disability compensation. Washington currently has approximately 530,000 resident veterans, but only 158,000 veterans are receiving federal benefits. Currently, veterans in 15 Washington counties receive benefits at or above the national average, 21 counties are within 10 percent of the national average, and three counties are more than 10 percent below the national average.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Therefore, the legislature intends to expand the veterans service officer program started in 2019 to increase the number of veterans applying for and receiving federal benefits. The program's first veterans service officer assisting veterans in the identification of benefits and filing of claims increased the number of veterans applying for benefits from 13 in the first year to 323 in the third year, and from no annual disability payments to $2,696,524 in federal benefits each year. The Washington state department of veterans affairs' September 30, 2024, veterans service officer program report estimates the cost to expand the program is $160,000 per year for each additional county. The legislature intends to expand the program by one to two veterans service officers per biennium beginning with the counties with the lowest percentage of benefits received, until all counties are at or above the national average.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">Additionally, the legislature intends to expand available funding sources for veterans services by allowing counties to collect the veterans' assistance property tax levy as a separate levy in addition to their general levy rate.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.60A'>43.60A</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The department must support veterans by providing information regarding available veterans services.

The key changes focus on expanding the veterans service officer program and altering provisions for funding veteran assistance programs. The amendments aim to ensure more veterans can access federal benefits and improve the overall funding framework for related services. This is expected to help more veterans receive the benefits they are entitled to and make the process of accessing these benefits more efficient.</p>\n<h3>Key Changes</h3>\n<h4>Expansion of Services</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Addition of new provisions allowing counties to collect a veterans' assistance property tax levy as a separate levy alongside their general levy, thereby expanding funding sources for veterans' services.</li>\n<li>Continued expansion of the veterans service officer program, specifically by introducing more veterans service officers in underserved counties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Changes to Existing Sections</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Sec. 3. Definition of \"eligible counties\" has been clarified to exclude the population criteria and focus on the percentage of veterans receiving federal benefits.</li>\n<li>Sec. 4. Amendments specify that the veterans' assistance fund will now have more flexibility in taxation, establishing that counties can impose taxes specifically for veterans assistance, independent of general property tax levies.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Reporting Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates to reporting requirements in Sec. 2, now mandate biennial reports beginning December 1, 2026, on the state of veterans' services, including detailed data on the number of veterans served and resources available in each county.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Effective and Expiration Dates</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New sections have been included to specify when certain provisions take effect (January 1, 2027) and when others will expire, ensuring clear timelines for implementation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These changes reflect a commitment to addressing the needs of veterans and enhancing the support systems available to them.</p>"
