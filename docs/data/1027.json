The bill aims to ensure that inmates who have been convicted of sex offenses against victims of the same biological sex will not be placed in facilities primarily housing individuals of that sex, which is intended to enhance safety and security in correctional environments.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Housing Restrictions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An inmate who has previously been convicted of a sex offense against a victim of the same biological sex cannot be housed in a correctional facility that primarily houses persons of that same biological sex.</li>\n</ul>"
