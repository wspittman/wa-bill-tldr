Key changes in this version include provisions that allow cities and counties to ease restrictions on building modifications for residential housing, particularly retrofitting and new construction that meets passive house standards. The impact of these changes aims to facilitate the development of more affordable housing options while adhering to modern sustainability standards.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Building Modifications for Existing Structures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities or counties must permit:<ul>\n<li>Increased projection of insulation in exterior wall assemblies by up to eight inches into setbacks.</li>\n<li>Slightly higher maximum roof heights (up to eight inches) to allow for additional insulation.</li>\n<li>Measurement of gross floor area from the interior face of the exterior walls, including drywall.</li></ul></li>\n<li>For existing nonconforming buildings, similar allowances apply if repurposed for residential use.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>New Construction and Passive House Standards</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>New constructions or retrofits meeting passive house criteria must follow:<ul>\n<li>Setback measurements from the outside face of the foundation.</li>\n<li>Similar allowances for insulation protrusion and roof height as above.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Housing Density and Parking Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Cities may not:<ul>\n<li>Limit housing unit density by more than 50% above zoning limits for projects within existing building envelopes in multifamily zones.</li>\n<li>Impose parking requirements for new or retrofitted units within existing buildings, although retention of existing parking for other uses is permissible.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Design and Permitting Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Limitations set on design standards:<ul>\n<li>No additional permitting requirements beyond general residential ones for existing buildings.</li>\n<li>No added design or architectural standards unnecessarily imposed on residential uses.</li>\n<li>Safety and life standards must be met but do not require outdated compliance for unchanged parts of buildings.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Solar Energy and Height Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Allow buildings to exceed maximum roof height by at least 48 inches for solar energy panels, with the definition of solar panels provided.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Off-Street Parking Exemption</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Off-street parking is not required for:<ul>\n<li>Affordable housing, new constructions, retrofits meeting passive house standards, modular, or mass timber constructions unless safety evidence can justify otherwise.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Size Restrictions for Affordable Units</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Affordable housing units for low-income households must not exceed specified sizes:<ul>\n<li>400 sq ft for studios, 550 sq ft for one-bedroom, 750 sq ft for two-bedroom, and 1,000 sq ft for three-bedroom units.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Cities must allow comparable size for affordable units if the average is smaller in a project.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These provisions focus on enhancing housing availability and promoting sustainability while ensuring local zoning laws are aligned with modern development needs.</p>"
