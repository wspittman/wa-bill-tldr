      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1069 is to allow collective bargaining over contributions for certain supplemental retirement benefits. This change aims to enhance the rights of employee organizations in negotiations regarding additional retirement options. Previously, retirement plans and benefits managed by the department of retirement systems were not subject to bargaining, but this bill proposes to change that and allows for negotiation regarding contributions towards supplemental retirement benefits.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Management Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill outlines that employers shall not bargain over management rights, which include:<ul>\n<li>The functions and programs of the employer, the use of technology, and the organization structure.</li>\n<li>The employer's budget and the specification of necessary appropriations for agreements during negotiations.</li>\n<li>The right to direct and supervise employees.</li>\n<li>The right to undertake actions necessary to fulfill state missions during emergencies.</li>\n<li>Retirement plans and benefits administered by the department of retirement systems are noted as management rights, butâ€¦</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Collective Bargaining on Retirement Benefits</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill specifies that the restriction on bargaining over retirement plans does not apply to:<ul>\n<li>Contributions for supplemental retirement benefits managed by, or on behalf of, an employee organization, including related medical plans. </li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This allows for a new layer of negotiation concerning supplemental benefits that were previously excluded from discussions.</p>"
