It seeks to strengthen the legal framework by explicitly stating the actions that can be classified as hate crimes. Key changes include specific examples of actions considered to be hate crimes and clarifications on the intent required for prosecution. The bill aims to enhance protections for individuals targeted based on their identity, thus signaling a commitment to combating hate-based violence.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Hate Crime Offense Definition</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person commits a hate crime if they maliciously and intentionally:<ul>\n<li>Assault another person.</li>\n<li>Cause physical damage to or destruction of another person's property.</li>\n<li>Threaten an individual or group, instilling reasonable fear of harm.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Inference of Threat</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>During prosecution for hate crimes:<ul>\n<li>Certain actions (e.g., burning a cross, defacing property with hate symbols) can lead the court to infer the intent to threaten based on the victim's identity.</li>\n<li>This applies only for evidentiary purposes and does not limit prosecutions under general hate crime provisions.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Defense Limitations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person cannot use the defense that they mistakenly believed the victim belonged to a particular protected class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Evidence Guidelines</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Expressions or associations of the accused can only be introduced if they are directly relevant to the crime charged.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Separate Prosecutions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If a person commits any other crime while committing a hate crime, they can be prosecuted for both separately.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Classification and Penalties</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Hate crime offenses are classified as a class C felony.</li>\n<li>Victims are still entitled to all other legal remedies available, regardless of this specific provision.</li>\n<li>The bill does not expand civil rights or protections beyond what is already established under existing laws.</li>\n</ul>"
