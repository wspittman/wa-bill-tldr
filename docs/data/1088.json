Recognizing the fundamental importance of stable housing for individuals and communities, it is evident that changes in societal and economic conditions may have impacted the effectiveness of the residential landlord-tenant act. Furthermore, differences in local ordinances have prevented consistent delivery and implementation of state law. The legislature acknowledges the need to adapt and enhance the current regulatory framework to address emerging challenges, ensure fair treatment for both landlords and tenants, and uphold the principles of housing stability and equity.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(2) Therefore, the legislature intends to establish a task force dedicated to a comprehensive study of the residential landlord-tenant act. This task force will undertake a meticulous review of the existing legislation, analyzing its provisions, enforcement mechanisms, and practical implications. By soliciting input from diverse stakeholders, including landlords, tenants, legal experts, housing advocates, and industry representatives, the task force aims to gain a nuanced understanding of the contemporary issues within the residential rental sector. The legislature intends for this collaborative effort to result in evidence-based recommendations for potential amendments or enhancements to the residential landlord-tenant act, fostering a balanced and fair relationship between landlords and tenants while addressing the evolving needs of Washington's housing landscape.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span><span style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1)(a) A task force on revising the residential landlord-tenant act is established, with members as provided in this subsection.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(i) The president of the senate shall appoint one member from each of the two largest caucuses of the senate.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(ii) The speaker of the house of representatives shall appoint one member from each of the two largest caucuses of the house of representatives.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(iii) The president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives jointly shall appoint the following members:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(A)  One representative of the for-profit residential property management and operations industry specializing in management of residential properties with 20 or more rental units;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(B) Two representatives of the residential property management and operations industry specializing in management of residential properties with between one and four rental units, with one representative from east of the crest of the Cascade mountains and one representative from west of the crest of the Cascade mountains;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(C) One representative of the nonprofit residential property management and operations industry;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(D) One representative of the real estate sales profession;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(E) One representative of the for-profit housing development industry;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(F) One representative of the nonprofit housing development industry;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(G) One representative of a statewide tenant legal aid association;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(H) One representative from a tenant-based organization representing historically underserved populations;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(I) One representative of public housing authorities created under chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=35.82'>35.82</a> RCW;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(J) Two representatives of the association of Washington cities, with one representative from a city that is located east of the crest of the Cascade mountains and one representative from a city that is located west of the crest of the Cascade mountains;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(K) One representative from the superior court judges' association; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(L) The director of the department of commerce or the director's designee.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The task force shall choose its chair or cochairs from among its membership.
