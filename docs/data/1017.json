Kimchi is found for sale across the United States at major retailers and is becoming an international staple as an excellent source of probiotics, filate, beta-carotene, choline, potassium, calcium, and vitamins A, C, and K, many of which contribute to lower rates of stroke, cancer, and diabetes. The legislature further finds that South Korea celebrates \"national kimchi day\" on November 22nd, representing the 11 major ingredients and 22 health benefits of the dish. The states of California, Virginia, and Hawaii also recognize this day. The legislature intends to join these governments by recognizing November 22nd of each year as \"kimchi day.\"</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=1.16.050'>1.16.050</a> and 2024 c 76 s 3 are each amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The following are state legal holidays:</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(a) Sunday;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(b) The first day of January, commonly called New Year's Day;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(c) The third Monday of January, celebrated as the anniversary of the birth of Martin Luther King, Jr.;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(d) The third Monday of February, to be known as Presidents' Day and celebrated as the anniversary of the births of Abraham Lincoln and George Washington;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(e) The last Monday of May, commonly known as Memorial Day;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(f) The nineteenth day of June, recognized as Juneteenth, a day of remembrance for the day the African slaves learned of their freedom;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(g) The fourth day of July, the anniversary of the Declaration of Independence;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(h) The first Monday in September, to be known as Labor Day;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(i) The eleventh day of November, to be known as Veterans Day;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(j) The fourth Thursday in November, to be known as Thanksgiving Day;</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(k) The Friday immediately following the fourth Thursday in November, to be known as Native American Heritage Day; and</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(l) The twenty-fifth day of December, commonly called Christmas Day.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(2) Employees of the state and its political subdivisions, except employees of school districts and except those nonclassified employees of institutions of higher education who hold appointments or are employed under contracts to perform services for periods of less than twelve consecutive months, are entitled to one paid holiday per calendar year in addition to those specified in this section.
