The environmental protection agency has found that lead emissions from certain aircraft engines cause or contribute to lead air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health, and Washington state has a critical interest in ensuring that alternatives to such fuels are broadly available and utilized by the aviation community. In compliance with the clean air act, federal agencies, aviation experts, engineers, and chemists have worked tirelessly to develop alternative lead-free aviation fuel that can be safely utilized by standard piston powered airplanes. The result of this coordinated effort was successful development of an alternative lead-free fuel, yet commercial availability and widespread adoption of this alternative lead-free fuel remains a challenge. The legislature intends to incentivize the widespread adoption of lead-free aviation fuel through providing various excise tax exemptions for both businesses and consumers who utilize these safer alternatives.</span><!-- field: --></div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>RCW  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=82.42.010'>82.42.010</a> and 2024 c 1 s 17 are each reenacted and amended to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->The definitions in this section apply throughout this chapter unless the context clearly requires otherwise.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(1) \"Air carrier\" means any airline, air cargo carrier, air taxi, air commuter, or air charter operator, that provides routine air service to the general population for compensation or hire, and operates at least ((<span style=\"text-decoration:line-through;\">fifteen</span>))<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">15</span> round trips per week between two or more points and publishes flight schedules which specify the times, days of the week, and points between which it operates.
