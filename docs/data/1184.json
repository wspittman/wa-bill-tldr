When fully implemented in 2028, the minimum salary to be classified as a salaried exempt employee will be two and a half times the statewide minimum wage for a 40-hour week, which is estimated to be approximately $93,000 a year and the highest salary threshold in the nation.

      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1184 is to create a narrow exemption from overtime pay regulations for certain nonprofit organizations and small businesses in Washington. The bill aims to provide these entities with increased flexibility regarding salary structures, especially as the state increases the salary threshold for exempt employees. The legislation recognizes that the significant financial burden of the upcoming salary threshold, projected to be around $93,000 annually by 2028, could jeopardize the operations of smaller nonprofits and businesses, potentially limiting their ability to serve the community.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Overtime Exemption for Nonprofits and Small Businesses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A new exemption from overtime provisions will be established for employees of nonprofit organizations and small businesses.</li>\n<li>Exempt employees must be paid a predetermined fixed salary that is at least 1.5 times the state minimum wage for a 40-hour workweek.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definitions and Criteria for Exemption</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Nonprofit Organization</strong>: Defined as a 501(c)(3), (5), or (6) organization with:<ul>\n<li>No more than 50 full-time equivalent employees at any worksite.</li>\n<li>Essential services that require state-mandated staffing levels.</li>\n<li>A 24/7 operation meeting critical community needs.</li></ul></li>\n<li><strong>Small Business</strong>: Any independently owned entity with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent employees.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Modifications to Existing Regulations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill amends existing regulations in RCW 49.46.130 regarding employment hours and overtime compensation.</li>\n<li>It maintains the requirement that no employee shall work more than 40 hours per week without receiving overtime pay unless otherwise specified in the new provisions.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Retrospective Protections</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>No claims for unpaid overtime due to the exclusion from overtime rules prior to November 5, 2020, shall result in damages or penalties against employers of agricultural or dairy employees.</li>\n<li>This provides a form of legal protection for employers based on historical exemptions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill is aimed at alleviating potential financial stress on smaller entities, allowing them to adapt to changing economic conditions while still attempting to offer competitive salaries.</p>"
