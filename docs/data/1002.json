      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this bill is to officially recognize posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as an occupational disease for county coroners, examiners, and investigative personnel. This change aims to provide them with the same protections and considerations that currently apply to first responders like firefighters and law enforcement officers regarding mental health claims. Key changes include the inclusion of county coroners and medical examiner personnel under the same provisions as those already in place for firefighters and other public safety roles.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Occupational Disease Claims</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill amends RCW 51.08.142 to state that PTSD is considered an occupational disease for specified personnel, including:<ul>\n<li>County coroners and medical examiner personnel.</li>\n<li>Firefighters and law enforcement officers under certain conditions.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Psychological Examination Requirement</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals applying for PTSD-related claims must submit to a psychological examination to rule out preexisting PTSD as part of their employment conditions. This requirement also applies to:</li>\n<li>Firefighters hired after June 7, 2018.</li>\n<li>Law enforcement officers hired after the same date.</li>\n<li>Public safety telecommunicators hired after June 11, 2020.</li>\n<li>County coroners and medical examiner personnel hired after January 1, 2026.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Exclusions from Occupational Disease Definition</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PTSD will not be considered an occupational disease if it results directly from:<ul>\n<li>Disciplinary actions taken in good faith by an employer.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Specific provisions are included for direct care registered nurses, stating that PTSD claims are valid only if symptoms develop after at least 90 consecutive days of employment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill ensures that mental health conditions like PTSD are addressed within the framework of occupational diseases, providing critical support and acknowledgment for those in demanding public service roles.</p>"
