High rents have become a substantial burden for too many Washingtonians, limiting their ability to access safe and affordable housing. This situation creates economic instability and negatively impacts the overall well-being of individuals and families across the state. This strain contributes to financial insecurity, making it challenging for individuals and families of all shapes and sizes to meet other essential needs, such as health care, education, and savings for the future. This phenomenon exacerbates existing inequalities and hinders economic mobility for a significant portion of the population.</span><!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(2) The legislature has taken significant steps to address the affordable housing crisis, including investing in housing development, expanding rental assistance programs, and enacting tenant protections. However, these efforts will take time to bear fruit, and many households continue to face immediate financial hardship due to high rental costs.</div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\">(3) Therefore, the legislature intends to address the issue of housing affordability by establishing a tenant assistance program. This program aims to reduce the number of people who are rent-burdened by providing financial assistance to eligible individuals and families. This program seeks to create a more equitable and accessible housing market, fostering stability and opportunity for Washington residents. By implementing this program, the legislature aims to alleviate the economic strain caused by high rents, promote housing security, and enhance the overall quality of life for residents of the state.</div><!-- field: --><div style=\"margin-top:0.25in;text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: BeginningSection --><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">NEW SECTION.</span><span>  </span><span style=\"font-weight:bold;padding-right:0.1in;\">Sec. 2.  </span>A new section is added to chapter  <a href='http://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=43.31'>43.31</a> RCW to read as follows:<!-- field: --></div><div style=\"text-indent:0.5in;\"><!-- field: Text -->(1) The tenant assistance program is created as a grant program administered by the department of commerce.
