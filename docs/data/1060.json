      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1060 is to amend the tax regulations concerning newspapers and eligible digital content in Washington State. The bill updates the exemptions for taxes related to the activities of printing and publishing newspapers and digital content, specifically targeting tax classifications tied to the reporting period since January 1, 2008. The bill aims to support the newspaper industry and digital content publishers by providing tax relief, thereby encouraging these entities to continue their operations and maintain public access to information. Key changes include clarifying eligibility for tax exemptions and detailing consequences for non-compliance with reporting requirements.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Tax Exemptions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Activities such as printing a newspaper or publishing digital content are exempt from specific taxes.</li>\n<li>The exemption must be reduced by any expenditures made during the tax reporting period.</li>\n<li>A single, nonvariable fee charged for advertising or subscribing that covers both eligible publications and other types remains entirely exempt from taxes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Eligible digital content\" is defined as a publication released at regular intervals (at least once a month), containing identified authorship material, and available exclusively in electronic form.</li>\n<li>The exemption applies only to those primarily engaged in relevant publishing activities, excluding those where such activities were not the primary focus of an affiliated business.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Compliance and Reporting</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete annual tax performance report must be filed by individuals claiming the exemption.</li>\n<li>Non-compliance with the reporting requirement subjects individuals to taxation based on gross income at a specified rate of 0.484%.</li>\n<li>If an exemption is found improperly granted, the taxes must be paid retroactively, along with accruing interest but no penalties.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Effective Dates and Expiration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Section 1 of the act, which establishes the initial amendments, will expire on January 1, 2026.</li>\n<li>Section 2, which reenacts and amends previous legislation, will take effect on January 1, 2026, and expire on January 1, 2034.</li>\n</ul>"
