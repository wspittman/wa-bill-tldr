      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1199 is to enhance consumer protection by increasing the accountability of insurers for violations of the insurance code. The bill aims to provide the Insurance Commissioner with stronger enforcement powers against violations, making it easier to impose penalties and ensure restitution to affected consumers. Key changes from the previous version include the introduction of a clearer framework for issuing cease and desist orders, increasing fines for violations, and detailing the process for ordering restitution with interest.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Insurer Accountability</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Insurance Commissioner can now issue cease and desist orders when he or she believes there is a violation of the insurance code.</li>\n<li>The Commissioner can bring legal action to stop ongoing violations or actions that contribute to such violations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Restitution Orders</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The Commissioner is authorized to order the payment of restitution, which requires regulated individuals to pay back any money or property owed to others, with an added interest of 8%.</li>\n<li>Restitution payments must be completed within 30 days of the order.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Fines and Penalties</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The maximum fine for violations of insurance laws has been raised to $10,000 per breach.</li>\n<li>Insurers can be fined an amount ranging from $250 to $10,000, with clear deadlines for payment between 15 and 30 days from the date of the fine order.</li>\n<li>Failure to pay the fines can result in the revocation of the insurer's certificate of authority. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>This bill strengthens the regulatory framework for insurance providers, ultimately aiming to protect consumers better and ensure compliance with state laws.</p>"
