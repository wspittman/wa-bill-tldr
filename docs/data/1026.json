      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1026 is to enhance financial protections for spouses within the long-term services and supports trust program. This bill allows qualified individuals to share their available benefit units with their spouses, thereby ensuring that spouses can access necessary support even if they do not directly qualify under existing criteria. The key change is the introduction of a mechanism for benefit unit transfer, which increases the flexibility of the program to accommodate family needs.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Benefit Unit Transfer</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A qualified individual can transfer any or all of their available benefit units to their spouse under specific conditions:<ul>\n<li>The receiving spouse must either:<ul>\n<li>Not qualify as a \"qualified individual\" under RCW 50B.04.050 and be determined eligible after evaluation; or</li>\n<li>Be a \"qualified individual\" who has met the criteria and has exhausted their own benefit units after evaluation.</li></ul></li></ul></li>\n<li>When benefit units are transferred, the same amount will be deducted from the transferring individual's available benefits.</li>\n</ul>"
