      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of this bill is to allow collective bargaining over contributions for certain supplemental retirement benefits for public employees in Washington State. It amends existing law, specifically RCW 41.80.040, to clarify the areas in which employers can negotiate with employee organizations. Notably, the bill expands the scope of bargaining to include contributions for these supplemental benefits, which had not been explicitly included before.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Management Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The employer retains the authority over various management rights, including:<ul>\n<li>The functions and programs of the employer, the use of technology, and the organization structure.</li>\n<li>The employer's budget, which includes specifications of funds or accounts required for fulfilling agreements.</li>\n<li>The right to direct and supervise employees.</li>\n<li>The right to take actions necessary for the mission of state agencies during emergencies.</li>\n<li>The administration of retirement plans and benefits by the department of retirement systems.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Bargaining Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Subsection (1)(e) clearly states that while management retains control over retirement plans, it does not prevent bargaining over supplemental retirement benefits, which includes contributions managed by employee organizations and possibly medical plans.</li>\n</ul>"
