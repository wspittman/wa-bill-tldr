      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1091 is to establish that sexually violent predators are ineligible to earn supervision compliance credit while supervised by the Department of Corrections. This change amends an existing law to tighten the regulations around the supervision of offenders deemed sexually violent. The key change from the previous version allows lawmakers to clearly state that certain high-risk offenders will not qualify for credits that could reduce their supervision time.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Supervision Compliance Credit Ineligibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Offenders sentenced as sexually violent predators cannot earn supervision compliance credit.</li>\n<li>Specific RCW provisions are listed under which offenders are ineligible for supervision credit:<ul>\n<li>Sentenced under RCW 9.94A.507 or 10.95.030.</li>\n<li>Sentenced under RCW 9.94A.650, 9.94A.655, 9.94A.660, or 9.94A.670.</li>\n<li>Subject to supervision as per RCW 9.94A.745.</li>\n<li>Serving an indeterminate sentence with parole under RCW 9.95.017.</li>\n<li>In community custody due to early release under RCW 9.94A.730.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Specific Conditions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Offenders serving concurrent sentences with less restrictive alternatives supervised under RCW 71.09.092 are also ineligible for supervision compliance credit.</li>\n</ul>"
