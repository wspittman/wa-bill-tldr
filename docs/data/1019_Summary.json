      "summary": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1019 is to introduce tax incentives for farmers in Washington State to encourage their participation in conservation programs. The bill allows qualified farmers to receive a tax credit for a portion of their expenditures on necessary agricultural investments. This aims to support sustainable farming practices and expand conservation efforts across the state. The key change from previous legislation is the establishment of a defined tax credit mechanism specifically for farmers making qualified purchases, with an expiration date set for January 1, 2036.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Tax Credit for Farmers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A tax credit of 25% is allowed against taxes starting January 1, 2026, for qualified expenditures made in the previous year. </li>\n<li>Expenditures eligible for the credit include new equipment, infrastructure, seed, seedlings, spores, animal feed, and amendments.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Eligibility Criteria</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>To qualify for the credit, farmers must meet at least one criterion:<ul>\n<li>Receive grant funds directly from the Washington state conservation commission, or indirectly through a conservation district or other public entity.</li>\n<li>Participate in a conservation program run by the Washington state conservation commission or a conservation district.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Credit Limitations and Carryovers</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The tax credit claimed cannot exceed the tax due. </li>\n<li>Unused credits may be carried over for one additional calendar year but cannot be carried over past that.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Application and Documentation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>An application is not required to claim the credit, but farmers must maintain records to verify eligibility, including documentation of received grant funds and proof of program participation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Implementation and Review</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The department may establish rules to implement the credit program.</li>\n<li>A performance statement has been created to evaluate the effectiveness of the tax preference, focusing on inducing farmers to participate in conservation programs. </li>\n<li>If increased participation is observed, the legislature may consider extending the expiration date of the tax preference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Expiration</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>This tax incentive will expire on January 1, 2036.</li>\n</ul>"
