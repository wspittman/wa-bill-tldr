      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The primary goal of this bill is to ensure that insurance coverage is available for the diagnosis and treatment of infertility, along with standard fertility preservation services. The legislature acknowledges that infertility affects a significant portion of the population, with impacts on health outcomes and healthcare costs. By providing this coverage, the bill aims to improve access to necessary medical services for individuals facing infertility challenges, consequently addressing disparities in care among various demographic groups, including racial and ethnic minorities and LGBTQ individuals.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Coverage Requirements</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Standard Fertility Preservation Services (Effective January 1, 2026)</strong>: All group health plans must include coverage for standard fertility preservation services.</li>\n<li><strong>Infertility Diagnosis and Treatment (Effective January 1, 2027)</strong>: Group health plans must cover infertility diagnosis and treatment, specifically including:<ul>\n<li>Two completed oocyte retrievals with unlimited embryo transfers per patient.</li>\n<li>Use of single embryo transfer when recommended by medical professionals.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Provisions Against Limitations</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Equalization of Benefits</strong>: Coverage for these infertility services must be equal to other pregnancy-related benefits.</li>\n<li><strong>Restrictions on Coverage Limitations</strong>: <ul>\n<li>No exclusions or limitations for fertility medications different from other prescription medications.</li>\n<li>No restrictions based on participation in third-party fertility services.</li>\n<li>No additional deductibles, copayments, benefit maximums, or waiting periods for these services that differ from those related to non-infertility conditions.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Medicaid and State Health Plans</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Coverage for standard fertility preservation services must also be provided under Medicaid as per the guidelines for health plans under state authority, mirroring the same provisions against limitations as above.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Definitions and Clarifications</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill establishes definitions related to infertility and treatment procedures to ensure clarity and compliance with established medical guidelines.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The insurance commissioner is authorized to adopt rules for the implementation, administration, and enforcement of the provisions related to infertility diagnosis and treatment.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This comprehensive approach is referred to as the \"Washington State Building Families Act\" and aims to facilitate better family planning options for those facing infertility issues.</p>"
