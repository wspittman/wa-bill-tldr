      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1045 is to expand the definition of \"uniformed personnel\" to include all law enforcement officers working for cities, towns, or counties in Washington State. The bill amends existing law (RCW 41.56.030) to remove previous population restrictions that limited the designation to certain areas. The intent is to ensure that more law enforcement officers fall under these protections and provisions, which could enhance job security and benefits for those officers.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Amendments to Uniformed Personnel Definition</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The term \"uniformed personnel\" now includes:<ul>\n<li>All law enforcement officers employed by any city or town, regardless of population size.</li>\n<li>All law enforcement officers employed by counties, with the previous population restrictions removed.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Additional Categories of Uniformed Personnel</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The definition also encompasses:<ul>\n<li>Various correctional employees (both uniformed and non-uniformed) at jails within specified population limits.</li>\n<li>General authority Washington peace officers employed by port districts in large counties.</li>\n<li>Firefighters, public safety telecommunicators, and specific advanced life support technicians employed by public entities.</li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This expansion aims to provide broader collective bargaining rights and protections for all law enforcement and associated personnel, thereby promoting better workplace standards and conditions for these public servants.</p>"
