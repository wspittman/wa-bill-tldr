      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The purpose of House Bill 1196 is to revise the rules regarding the revocation of voting rights for individuals based on criminal convictions. The bill specifies that a person's voting rights can only be revoked if they are convicted of a state crime that is punishable by death, referred to as an \"infamous crime.\" This change aims to limit the circumstances under which voting rights can be lost and to clarify the process for restoring these rights after a conviction. The impact of this bill is to potentially increase the number of individuals eligible to vote who have been previously convicted of less severe crimes.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Revocation of Voting Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A person’s right to vote is revoked only if they are convicted in a Washington state court of an \"infamous crime\" and sentenced to total confinement under the jurisdiction of the department of corrections.</li>\n<li>Voting rights are automatically restored under specific conditions as outlined in relevant state law.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Restoration of Voting Rights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Individuals whose voting rights have been revoked must re-register after their rights are restored.</li>\n<li>The Secretary of State will regularly compare voter registration lists with lists of individuals not eligible to vote and will notify ineligible voters of their status.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Voter Registration Oath</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>All registrants must sign an oath confirming they are not disqualified from voting due to a court order and are not currently serving a sentence for an infamous crime.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Challenges to Voting Eligibility</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Provisions are established for challenging a voter's eligibility, particularly focusing on convictions of infamous crimes and incorrect addresses.</li>\n<li>Specific steps must be taken to verify the eligibility of a challenged voter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Voting Procedures</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Voting materials must inform voters about their eligibility and provide instructions on how to vote.</li>\n<li>Stress is placed on the requirement that voters not serving total confinement for an infamous crime must properly declare their eligibility when registering or voting.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Jury Service</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The bill clarifies that individuals convicted of an infamous crime and not having restored their rights are disqualified from serving as jurors.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>General Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If any part of the bill is deemed invalid, the remainder of the act remains effective.</li>\n<li>The bill is referred to as the \"Free the Vote Act,\" highlighting its focus on expanding voting rights.</li>\n</ul>"
