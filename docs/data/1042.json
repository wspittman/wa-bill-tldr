      "text": "<h3>Purpose</h3>\n<p>The main goal of House Bill 1042 is to enable county treasurers in Washington State to recover costs associated with the billing, collection, and distribution of property taxes for various taxing districts. This bill recognizes the significant role of county treasurers, who manage financial operations for multiple local government entities. It allows them to charge a cost recovery fee to these taxing districts, which will help cover expenses incurred during tax collection. Key changes from existing laws include the ability to establish a fee structure based on real costs and the exclusion of certain collections from the fee calculations.</p>\n<h3>Key Provisions</h3>\n<h4>Cost Recovery Fee</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>A county treasurer may set a cost recovery fee, which will recover actual prior year costs on a pro rata basis from the tax rolls of each taxing district.</li>\n<li>The first $50,000 of a district's tax collections is excluded from the fee calculation.</li>\n<li>The fee cannot exceed:<ul>\n<li>1% of the tax roll for counties larger than 250,000 residents.</li>\n<li>2% of the tax roll for counties smaller than 250,000 residents.</li></ul></li>\n<li>Costs associated with specific existing administrations (real estate excise tax, foreclosure, etc.) are not eligible for recovery.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Funding and Credit</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Recovered costs must go into the county treasurer's cost recovery fund, freed from budget limitations, to support ongoing operations.</li>\n<li>The county treasurer is required to inform taxing districts of the cost recovery fee by September 1 of the current year.</li>\n<li>Capital expenditures recovery is limited to the useful life of the asset involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Taxing District Provisions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Taxing districts may levy taxes on all taxable property to cover:<ul>\n<li>Refunds for taxes, excluding specific previously refunded amounts as per RCW 84.69.020.</li>\n<li>Reimbursement for taxes that were abated or canceled, factoring in any supplemental taxes collected.</li>\n<li>Costs incurred due to the enforcement of the cost recovery fee under this act. </li></ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The bill outlines a structured framework for cost recovery aimed at ensuring the financial sustainability of tax collection processes while providing flexibility in addressing the needs of local government financing.</p>"
